<p>As we all know, Kirsty and Joe took Liberty Belle on a Christmas cruise. Kirsty has kindly written a newsletter to let us know how they got on.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3>24th December</h3>

<p>After a suspected, but not counted upon, lunchtime finish from work for Joe on Christmas Eve, we set off on our journey from Southampton to Thrupp, to find Liberty Belle where Rachel and Tony had left her. We located her easily, and unpacked the car fairly easily (as far as unpacking goes). What wasn't quite as easy was getting the fire going, especially in an unbelievably cold boat. I wouldn't say I'm an expert when it comes to fires, but I like to think that I'm somewhat skilled in the area. Unfortunately, I have zero experience with coal fires and even now I'm convinced that there's no rhyme nor reason to whether or not a coal fire remains successfully lit. Eventually Joe managed to get it roaring and we managed to thaw out...very slowly! We'd had a big lunch and so we had some of the leftover salad Rachel had gifted us the day before. At this point we hadn't quite anticipated that we'd be eating leftovers of this salad for about three days. As a result of the combination of the early morning, the early darkness, and the rate at which we were running out of audiobook to listen to which we'd started that very morning, we were both ready for bed by about 19:30 and slept well, if slightly chillily.</p>

<h3>25th December</h3>

<p>At around 09:30 on Christmas Day, I was dragged out of bed with the promise of a cup of tea and a lit fire. (It will soon become evident that my eternal reluctance to get out of bed ((even after 14 hours of sleep)) is a recurring theme.) We went straight to the Christmas tradition of completely abandoning any attempt at eating anything close to a nutritious breakfast and instead reached for the Lebkuchen as we opened presents. As the boat had not moved in days, we had to run the engine for a bit to generate hot water for our showers. Feeling clean and refreshed, we wandered down the road to The Jolly Boatman, where Rachel and Tony had kindly booked us in for Christmas lunch. The food was wonderful and plentiful, if not particularly Christmassy in nature. Joe altered his paper hat, adding a piece of elastic from an eyepatch found inside a cracker so that it fit his head; I must admit it was quite an ingenious piece of work. Somehow, we managed to be the first to enter and the last to leave. We then embarked on a walk in the attempt to walk off at least some of the too much food that we had just consumed and even managed to admire a church along the way. Back aboard Liberty Belle we played some card games, with a card game version of Monopoly proving to be a firm favourite. There was not too much demand for any tea, as we were both still far too full and we sat down by the fire to watch Love Actually (for the first time ever in my case) and ate some Pringles to tide our stomachs over until the morning.</p>

<h3>26th December</h3>

<p>On Boxing Day, with concerns about the short days and lack of travel time, we awoke at 07:30. After breakfast, featuring a fox sighting, we set off on our travels from Thrupp to Lower Heyford at around 09:00. It was a fairly uneventful day, and the lift bridge that had troubled Rachel in past weeks had seemingly been fixed. We were moored for the evening by around 15:00, after covering about 7 miles and 5 locks. Dinner consisted of veggie pigs in blankets (halloumi makes a great bacon substitute) and some leftovers. After more of our audiobook, more card games, and a film we went to bed.</p>

<h3>27th December</h3>

<p>Surprised by the miles we'd covered the day before, we decided on a slightly later start. Our plans for a cafe breakfast were thwarted by the fact that the cafe was closed for the entirety of the winter, so we settled for hot cross buns (because who doesn't love mix-and-matching holiday traditions) and set off around 10:00. We were getting used to the quiet canals when we encountered the first moving boat we had to pass. Luckily everything went smoothly. What didn't go quite as smoothly was the next lock we came to. After much effort, I finally managed to open the lock to allow Joe and Liberty Belle in. But when I tried to close the gate again I couldn't get it to budge. Pulling was having no effect, I couldn't swing round the side of it due to a sloped wall, and I was sure I'd fall into the canal if I attempted to push from the front. I insisted I would eventually manage to close the gate, but as I continued with my fruitless attempts and progressively became more and more tired, and in the end I had to enlist Joe's help. To my frustration, he proceeded to close it with ease. We stopped for lunch soon after (only partially as a result of my requests for sugar replenishment after my ordeal) and realized we were much closer to Banbury, our planned end-point, than we had expected. We decided that we would remain where we were moored for the night, and went for a walk with the few hours of daylight we had left. Our walk ended at a pub in Aynho. We assessed Aynho's boating facilities, where we planned to fill up on water the next day, and began another walk of about 2km along the canal back to the boat. This was our favourite mooring, a tranquil area of countryside with no other boats or people around.</p>

<h3>28th December</h3>

<p>We planned our move to Banbury, with a stop to fill up on water in Aynho along the way, and set off. This was, in my opinion, the best day of the trip. By this point, we were both into the swing of things and it was a relaxed day, plodding along in no hurry. We took turns at driving and walking between locks, and at quiet lock-free stretches of canal where both of us were on the boat, tea and cake was plentiful. With fears of the looming darkness and dreams of a Wetherspoons dinner in our heads, we managed to find mooring rings as we approached Banbury, very close to the train station, in fact. We headed into the town centre (more importantly, Spoons) and I enjoyed a satisfying (if very sad looking) veggie burger, with its single slither of tomato.</p>

<h3>29th December</h3>

<p>Thankful for our proximity to the train station which allowed us to catch a train 20 minutes after our wake up, we set off for a day in Oxford. The journey was spent watching for the canal, and marveling at how 20 minutes on a train could equate to a journey that had just taken us 3 days. Our first stop was, unsurprisingly, another Spoons, where over breakfast we discussed the potential for a Wetherspoons scratch map to document our visits to many national locations. It was a day filled mostly with wandering, and a trip to the Botanic Garden was not only relaxing and enlightening, but offered a much-wanted desire to spend some time in the warm. In the evening Joe caught the bus from Oxford to Thrupp then brought the car to Banbury, ready for our departure, while I got the train from Oxford back to Banbury. I even managed to have the fire started and the kettle boiled for his return.</p>

<h3>30th December</h3>

<p>There was but a short journey to go to move Liberty Belle to a better location to await Rachel and Tony's return. After my night of bizarre boat-related nightmares of which I have no recollection and seemed to terrify Joe, this was probably for the best. For breakfast, we headed to Morrisons Cafe and had massive breakfasts, all inside a massive roll. It was quite an intimidating amount of food which, needless to say, I could not finish. We had one more lock to go before we reached our planned new mooring point, and it was a busy one. We travelled through quickly, as we were the only boat going that direction, but there were three other boats waiting to go the other direction. While readying the lift bridge just beyond the lock, I spoke with a woman queuing for the lock, whose husband was using the forced stop close to facilities as an opportunity to empty their toilet. In my opinion, it was less a toilet and more an unnecessarily transparent and unofficial-looking container , a good few gallons in size, evidently full of wee. Curious to know what sophisticated system they were using that allowed them to use a random plastic bottle, but fearing that there probably was no sophisticated, in-built system, I fought the urge to ask, and remained in blissful ignorance. After mooring up for the last time of the trip, and a quick stroll round Banbury we headed home, saying our goodbyes to Liberty Belle, and hoping for another canal boating adventure very soon.</p>
