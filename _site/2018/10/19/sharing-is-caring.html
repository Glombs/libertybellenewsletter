<p>On towards Braunston's Art and Craft Festival, despite the wind and a red light on the console...!</p>

<p>The Grand Onion is grand in that it is wide and its locks are wide enough for two boats, side by side. So we can double up to save water, time and energy.</p>

<p>On this occasion we shared the locks with two pleasant and cheery couples on a boat-share boat. We stopped mid-locks for water and to investigate the alternator belt (there was a spare in the box of goodies. Yay!). Our lock buddies waited for us and we continued on together. So quite a sociable morning.</p>

<p>On our way we saw a boat with a crew of a man, a woman and 12 children. Their boat was crammed with bunk beds! It sounds like something from a nursery rhyme. I have no idea what the circumstances were but the woman remarked that she was hoping that they would still have 12 children at the bottom of the flight…. what a brave undertaking!</p>

<p>Beyond the locks we wished our buddies well and continued onwards to Braunston, still fighting the wind all the way. We arrived under cover of darkness with me standing at the front holding up the floppy headlight, trying to direct it somewhere useful whilst we tried to find somewhere to moor.</p>

<p>We finally slid into a mooring spot, only to discover that it belonged to a boat-hire firm and out of bounds. Our only other option was to continue through the next lock. I refused to operate a lock in the dark and was ready to explain that to anyone who complained. So, we tied up and set the alarm clock to get us up early. As the next day was a rainy Sunday, no-one took the trouble to bother us. We set off in our wet weather gear and moored up just beyond the first lock. For a few minutes work we had a boat full of dripping wet clothes!</p>

<p>We braved the weather for the much anticipated Braunston Art and Craft Village in the afternoon. The stalls were in pubs, garages, front rooms and kitchens along the village High Street. A great concept but it turned out that they were expecting people with fatter wallets than ours. Still, we had got there!</p>

<p>Later we warmed ourselves in a comfortable and friendly canal-side pub. We tried to replicate the temperature on the boat but the diesel heating refused to come on. We had run out of coal some days ago, so the fire was not an option... We both huddled under the blanket knitted (and backed) by Mary then transported across the country by Joe. Many thanks to you both!</p>

<p>Heading towards Northampton, our next lock buddy was a chap on his own; experienced and capable. He was very patient and good humoured, despite us presumably slowing him down.
We had half an hour in a tunnel after that. Tarka finds these very stressful so I took her into the boat with the blind down on the front door and the lights on, trying to keep her relaxed whilst Tony braved the dark, the cold and the drips on his own without his four-legged safety officer...</p>

<p>Over the next few days we continued down the Grand Onion, stopping off here and there and picking up coal and diesel. (Now that we have coal, the central heating seems to work just fine...)</p>

<p>Just in case you can't read it, the inscription on the gravestone is as follows:-</p>
<xmp>
In memory of
John, Son of
Peter and Eliz.
Hewitt of Rugby.
He was lost (by neglect)
Jan 16th 1806 in a field in
this Parish and was found
on the 18th starved to death
in the 6th year of his age.
'I cast my eyes on every side,
Finding my helpers gone.
Friends and neighbours pass me by,
Neglected and alone.'
</xmp>
