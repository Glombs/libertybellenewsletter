  <h1>Homeward Bound</h1>

<h2>Leamington Spa to Radford Semele</h2>
<h2>4th-9th October 2018</h2>

<p>Leaving Liberty Belle locked up at Leamington Spa, Mary, Tony, myself and Tarka trotted off to the railway station to catch a train. Simple.</p>

<p>Mary's off-peak return ticket was from Birmingham to Fareham. Tony checked and double checked the information on the website regarding return tickets and Mary was allowed to break her journey so could legitimately travel from Leamington Spa station (just down the line from Birmingham). Great. It was now off-peak. This should work.</p>

<p>Tony went to the very impressive looking ticket machine at Leamington Spa station to buy our tickets with our 'two-together' railcard. The Computer said 'No'.</p>
<p>No-one was manning the ticket office so he tried the machine again. The Computer still said 'No'.</p>

<p>We quickly relayed to Mary the information she needed for the journey and sent her through the barrier towards the train so that she, at least, can get home. Bye!</p>

<p>In the meantime a man had appeared at the ticket office. Tony explained which tickets he wanted and he was able to purchase them, no problem.
Great. We rush to the barrier a couple of feet away with our freshly bought tickets in hand but the barrier wouldn't accept them... Tarka was confused because she can get under the barrier, what's the problem? A kind railway employee saw us struggling, checked our tickets and lets us through the barrier....</p>

<p>Off we rushed and caught up with Mary. Phew!</p>

<p>The train arrived and we bundled on 3 people, 2 rucksacks a suitcase, a bag and a dog.... We all found positions to be in on the train and make ourselves comfortable. We gave Tarka a treat and a bowl of water and she settled down to sleep.</p>

<p>A ticket inspector came along and several people in our carriage (including Mary) are thrown off the train for having invalid tickets - the train left Birmingham station just before off-peak, apparently..... We woke up the deaf dog, gathered ourselves together, retrieved all our luggage and even remembered to pick up the bowl of water, trying not to slosh it on anyone or anything and got off at the next station.
We found the cafe and somehow ended up with a very wobbly table, a rucksack of dirty washing all-but mistaken for a bomb-scare, conveniences inconveniently positioned beyond the ticket barrier from the cafe and a confused dog who thought she was going on a train... We waited out the required hour and then set off again. Luckily we all found somewhere to leave the luggage and a seat each. The rest of the journey went very smoothly except that Tarka expected another treat which never came...</p>

<p>We spent a few days getting some jobs done including a pre-planned visit to family before returning to Leamington Spa. To our relief, Liberty Belle was still where we had left her and we were off again.</p>
