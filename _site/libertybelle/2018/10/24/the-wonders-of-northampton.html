<p>I cannot express how blissful it is, on a sunny autumn morning, chugging along with the mist rising to mingle with the smoke from the moored boats and the spiders webs glistening. The canal lined with hips, haws, sloes and crab-apples. The sky and trees perfectly reflected in the still water as the mist clears, making it feel as if we are flying.

<p>Continuing slowly along the Grand Onion we stopped off at a village called Nether Heyford where we came across a poster for a film night on that very evening. We decided on the spot to remain moored there for the night and go to see the film. We arrived at the appropriate time and were welcomed as celebrities, introduced to the assembled villagers and applauded...!</p>

<p>This friendly village, (where there seems to be a club for every day of the week), has a Welcome Pack, organised jointly by the two churches, which is given to anyone who moves into the village. This seems like a very sensible idea.</p>
<p>Bugbrooke was the next village. Here I managed to hook up one of our solar 'spike' lights with the rope as I was jumping off the boat to moor, flinging it into the canal just behind the propeller..... Oh *@#% ! Even Tony's luck with his fishing net wasn't up to to retrieving it. We use these to highlight our mooring pins so that no-one trips over them in the dark. We don't use them often as we like to moor with either rings or a chain but that's not always possible. Oh well, add it to the shopping list!</p>

<p>We had a little look around Bugbrooke which has an obsession with badgers. In the churchyard we found two very old gravestones next to each other, each marking the grave of a husband of Ellenor (Ellener). We wondered whether it was the same woman and at what age the first husband died and did she outlive her second husband and how old was Ellenor when she passed away? So many questions!
107 must have been an amazing age to get to in the 1600's!</p>

<p>Our next stop was at Gayton Junction where the Northampton Arm of the Grand Onion turns off to the North. We stayed the night here so that we could begin our journey to Northampton with the fresh enthusiasm of the morning as there are 16 locks to pass through. It took us 5 hours. We fully expected the canal to become less appealing on the way into the city but this was far from the truth. The whole arm is delightful and we had it almost to ourselves. In one of the tunnels was some excellent graffitti - a timeline of Northampton done by a local primary school which seems to have the Batman sign as their emblem. How cool is that?</p>
<p>We were sooo tired and hungry by the time we got there! After a large late lunch, we made ourselves walk into town to have a look around.</p>

<p>On Sunday we went into Northampton to do a bit of sightseeing. We followed signs to the Museum and Art gallery which turned out to be closed for refurbishment. Hmmm. Back to churches then!</p>

<p>First was 'All Saints Church and Bistro'. I am beginning to warm to Northampton! If this isn't odd enough, the Rector was issued with a parking ticket part way through the service! Sadly we missed this because we joined in (well, sat there...) too late but it was mentioned in the notices after the service.
We set off then to see the round church. Yep, round. Or at least it was a round church originally but it has been extended many times over the centuries. It is literally awesome. The whole space, but especially the original round church, are awe inspiring but also manage to feel cosy. I can't really explain. If you haven't been and you get a chance to visit, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Both of the churches we visited had a little encampment of homeless people's tents in the grounds. I cannot help feeling that this is as it should be.</p>
<p>Apart from the churches, Northampton also has several micro-breweries, a Lidl, an Aldi, a B&amp;Q, a fruit &amp; veg market and two Poundlands! What a place!</p>
