  <h2>Leamington Spa to Long Itchington</h2>
<h2>9th-12th October 2018</h2>

<p>Over the next couple of days we completed a few locks and even fewer miles. The water level in the canal was quite low so it felt as if Liberty Belle was chewing her way along instead of gliding. The weather, though, was beautiful.</p>

<p>We took our chance to explore a couple of  villages on the way.</p>
<p>We stopped off at Smelly Radford (oh, alright, Radford Semele), which turned out not to be in the least bit smelly and had a fine church (reputed to be lovely inside but was locked). Outside the church was an interesting bike rack and probably the oldest gravestone we have ever seen with the date still legible.

<p>We also stopped at Long Itchington. It is a very smart village, quite spread out and with a wide variety of buildings of different ages but they all seem to sit happily alongside each other. It has a large 100 year old village pond which has been lovingly restored, much to the delight of the local heron. It also boasts a beautiful church (open to visitors) with wooden organ pipes, a co-op (with a cashpoint no less), a canal boat builders (in case we lose this one...), a brand new war memorial (still being constructed), 6 pubs (at the last count) one of which does an excellent brunch (now, how would we know that?).

<p>On Thursday evening we walked the few yards to the pub, much to Tarka's delight. We mentioned the word and she went crazy, dragging us to the door (unfortunately it was the wrong door so we had to persuade her to use another entrance). Once inside Tony and I had beer, Tarka had her treat (plus some from the bar) and we had free WiFi with which to compile and send the newsletter. Whilst there Tony discovered a copy of a 'What's On Locally' publication and, leafing through it, came across an advert for a Craft Fair in Braunston at the coming weekend! Just the job! We could probably get there in time!</p>

<p>However, on Friday the weather was forecast to be very windy and wet so, although it would delay our visit to Braunston, we decided to stay where we were. (We could still get to the craft fair for Sunday...) Much to Tony's delight (?) this gave him the chance to get some DIY done.
Meanwhile I spent my time watching ducks trying to eat crab apples which were too big to swallow... After I realised what they were doing, I busied myself cutting up the apples and throwing them to the ducks, which they enjoyed but they continued to try and eat them whole again thereafter...</p>
