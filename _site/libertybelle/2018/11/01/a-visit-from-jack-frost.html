  <h2>Northampton to Braunston</h2>

<p>Turning Liberty Belle at Northampton we resorted to yanking her around with the bow rope as the wind was quite strong. We had 16 locks to look forward to before mooring up for the night. As my foot has improved a great deal and the canal was quiet I decided to take Liberty Belle's tiller and give Tony a chance to play with the windlass. He was joined by a homeless gentleman, Ian, camped on a grassy area alongside one of the locks, keeping himself busy by helping passing boats. Thanks to him running ahead to set the next lock and running back to help Tony with the current lock,  we were up at the top of the flight in double quick time! As we had set aside the whole day, this meant that we were able to get a lot further than we had planned. Initially this seemed like a good thing...</p>

<p>We were on our way to Norton Junction. Here, adjacent to mooring, is a Canal &amp; River Trust car park and facilities as well as a railway station within walking distance. The plan was to be there, poised for the delivery of our sofa bed, due to be ready for dispatch on 25th October and delivered to Merdon Avenue soon after that. In anticipation of this grand event Tony had been checking train times and van hire prices and we had worked out the logistics of the operation. To cut a long story a little shorter we had 4 days to get 2 miles. The 'slow bicycle race' began!</p>

<p>On the way we popped into Brockhall, Long Buckby and Norton.
In Norton we found 'The White Horse Inn &amp; Chippy' A restaurant/takeaway &amp; public house! We were too full up to have chips but managed a pint.</p>

<p>We moored up just below the top lock at Norton and waited for the phonecall that didn't come. Jack Frost made the first of several visits and we were grateful for our thermals, gloves and hats. By Tuesday 30th we thought we had better move on as we had been at our 48 hour mooring site for 4 nights..</p>

<p>Wrapped up against the cold we started heading for Braunston. This involves going through a long tunnel, which Tarka hates. In preparation I took her inside, switched on the lights, pulled down the blind, got the snacks ready and sat her on my lap. Tony was left to face the cold, dark, drippy (and not quite straight) tunnel on his own. It was a long 25 minutes for all concerned. We finally emerged and arrived in Braunston; this time in broad daylight.</p>
<p>A trip to Braunston's excellent butchers resulted in some Brauntson Bangers and a Pork Pie which contains a layer of black pudding! Oh my! (I would have taken a photo but we ate it...)</p>

<p>Tony took the chance to do some shopping in Daventry to get a few supplies. Tarka and I declined...</p>
