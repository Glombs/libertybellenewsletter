<p>We found a mooring at Fenny Compton close to its very handy Wharf Inn which is a pub, restaurant, shop and laundrette. It had good beer and cider, the chips were passable and the shop would be useful if you ran out of matches or 'Fruit Shoots'. Luckily the village has a co-op. Also just yards away was the marina with Canal &amp; River trust rubbish and recycling facility. However, our dog-ravaged rubbish had to wait in the front of the boat for Tony to carry it (double wrapped) to a village waste bin as the official facility is locked on Sundays and Mondays. Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>We attended the remembrance service at the Fenny Compton war memorial. We were concerned that we might stick out like sore thumbs at this event in such a small community, but no, the whole village must have turned out! It was very moving. We were particularly taken by a poem written by a local resident about a first World War soldier and his wounded horse.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Tony's attention was taken by the stream of cakes heading for the village hall and had to be dragged back to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>The rain held off and we all assembled in the village hall afterwards for coffee and cake. We chose an excellent fruit cake. (Tony having his fingers crossed throughout the ceremony obviously paid off. Sigh...)

<p>We walked to Wormleighton, a delightful village surrounded by undulating countryside with golden hawthorn hedges giving a sense of sunshine even as the dark clouds gathered. The outine of the remains of the medieval village can be seen in a field just outside the village, now inhabited by unimpressed looking sheep.</p>

<p>We only got a peep inside its church as it is being updated and renovated, but we did see its carved wooden screen and font lid which has a pulley system above to lift it. A few yards away was an impressive looking gatehouse with a bell inside striking the hour but no clock face to see. You'll have to take my word for all this as I forgot to put the memory card back inside the camera...</p>

<p>The next stretch of canal was pretty but so shallow that we struggled to keep up a speed of 0.5 mile an hour. Along the way we had a topless tunnel; a dead tree leaning over the canal which tried to brush Liberty Belle clear of everything, including us; lots of boats moored up for the winter, two abreast in some cases, and a series of 9 locks in lovely setting. At the locks we were met by Canal &amp; River Trust volunteer engineers who were on their second day of trying to empty enough water down the flight to refill the large pound outside Cropredy marina. What a palaver! It did mean that I had an easy time of it. One of the volunteers sent Liberty Belle out of one of the locks on a wave by opening up the lock paddles behind her on her way out. Wheeeee! (He did warn us beforehand...)</p>

<p>We glided past Cropredy Marina, (the refill having worked), which had acres of moored boats all in neat lines. At Cropredy village we searched for a suitable mooring, near a road so that Liberty Belle could have her solar panels fitted the next day, as planned. This was trickier than we had anticipated. We ended up squeezing into a space not quite big enough for us just at the mouth of a bridge... It turned out to be perfect. Mr. Tim Onboard-Solar arrived early the next morning and Liberty Belle had her solar panels before lunch! These will keep our domestic batteries topped up without running the engine. The fridge will be pleased!</p>

<p>Cropredy is a delightful village with a shop (situated next to our mooring!), two pubs, a church, a Hell Hole, a guided walk and a cafe. The village noticeboard is full of posters for up-coming events, all of which sound great! They even have an <a href="http://www.fairportconvention.com/">annual folk festival</a> which looks amazing (I might need to come back for that in August....). </p>
