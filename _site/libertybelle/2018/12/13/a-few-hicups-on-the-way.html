<p>Apology.
Before the start of this newsletter I want to apologise for being so flippant about the perspex person in the church in Cropredy. I was unaware of the possible significance. Liberty Belle's researchers have informed me that these are used to represent parishioners who lost their lives fighting for their country in the armed forces. I hope my ignorance didn't upset anyone. More <a href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/2-march/news/uk/there-but-not-there">information</a> </p>

<p>With the new garage doors fitted, we took the train back to Banbury to find Liberty Belle still there! Phew.
We explored the town a little more then went in search of the reservoir, just the other side of the Spiceball Park that we were moored alongside. It was very windy but the sun was shining when we set off.... we managed to shelter under a bridge during the worst of the hailstorm. The reservoir was a bit of a disappointment commandeered as it was by the local sailing club and surrounded by a high wire fence. However, there is a path on a bank beyond the perimeter from where you can see the birds on the other side of the fence.
Keen to get to Oxford before Christmas, we set off again.
Travelling along the Oxford canal is beautiful but slow going. To save construction money it is shallow and meanders around hills to avoid building locks. Occasionally a lock proved to be essential but, where most canals would have a series of locks, here they built a very deep single lock with just one, very heavy, gate at each end. (It must have been painful to watch me inching the gates open and closed!)</p>

<p>One of the features of the Oxford canal is the regular occurrence of lift bridges, used by farmers to link their fields. These are generally left open but are narrow, so slowing down is wise. Suddenly we came across one that had been lowered, so I jumped into action, trotted up the towpath, crossed the bridge and pulled down on one of its arms with all my might!  I couldn't shift it. Giving up I noticed a chain, released it from it's hook, then gently tipped the bridge up with one finger....</p>

<p>To make progress even slower, something got wrapped around Liberty Belle's propeller. Feet in the air and arm plunged into cold water in the weed hatch, Tony managed to release a fender and its tangled rope just before he lost the feeling in his fingers...!</p>

<p>The following day the engine overheated, twice. The first time we were near a bridge and were able to tie up whilst Tony, (wearing a serious face of concentration and a rhino-horn hat of ridicule), sorted it out. It happened a second time in a section of the canal where there was no towpath at all, either side. Tony used Liberty Belle's rudder as a paddle to propel us towards a semi-safe position. Poor Liberty Belle, how undignified. Luckily there was no-one else trying to travel along the canal. Tony finished fixing the problem, this time for good (?).</p>
<p>In engineering mode, Tony then tackled the problem of the solar panels not keeping the fridge going. Eureka! Tim had wired the solar panels to the starter battery instead of the domestic batteries... Contacting Tim, Tony discovered that he is now in India. Ok. A few photos and an email later, Tim agreed with Tony's diagnosis and Tony fixed it. Well done Tony!

<p>On our journey we stopped at Kings Sutton.  From our mooring we could see the magnificent spire of the Church of St Peter and St Paul to our left. Off we went for closer inspection and it certainly wasn't disappointing; both inside and out a truly beautiful church with its carved wooden rood screen still in place.

<p>On leaving Kings Sutton we were surprised to find the same beautiful spire to our right..... then on our left.... it followed us for quite some time, eventually retreating into the background where it watched us for the rest of the day...</p>

<p>Next stop, Aynho Wharf (the 'e' was dropped from Aynhoe sometime in history). We enquired after an engine service for Liberty Belle but there was "no chance". Oh well, worth a try!</p>

<p>Aynho village would have been just another smart but shopless village built around an historic country estate with a church and a set of stocks, but for two remarkable things. It has an apricot tree growing against every house wall along the main road and the church is rather odd. Most churches have been added to over the centuries in different styles to reflect the times, but this one looks like some poor creature made from the head of one animal and the body of another.</p>

<p>Onwards to explore Upper and Lower Heyford, two very pretty villages with house names like 'Old Forge', 'Old Bakehouse', 'Old School', 'Shop House', 'Old Reading Room'.... you get the idea. Happily they still each had a church that is a church (both locked) and a pub that is a pub.</p>
