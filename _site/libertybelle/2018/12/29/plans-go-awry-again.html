  <h2>Lower Heyford to Duke's Cut and back to Thrupp</h2>

<p>On the evening of 11th we visited the pub in Lower Heyford. We were having a quiet drink when a chap entered and, having got a beer from the bar, turned and asked us if we were boaters. Oh! Is it that obvious? 
It was a very pleasant evening, sharing narrow boat stories and experiences, but the worry that we were picked out like that still hasn't left me...</p>

<p>The following morning, (another beautiful sunny day), we set off again and had spotted four kingfishers and two red kites before lunch! We moored temporarily at Kirtlington for a break and a little explore then continued on our way, which included a brief spell on the River Cherwell. This experience was quite different from the canal. It makes the boat feel quite 'tippy'. This has made me a little anxious about going on the Thames in January...</p>
<p>We cruised until darkness forced us to stop in the only space left in a long string of moored boats. Unfortunately this was on a corner so poor Liberty Belle was sticking out at the back and the front, looking quite vulnerable. Not ideal.</p>

<p>We got up early and left before we became a problem for other boaters, although we hadn't met another cruising boat for quite a while. At this time of year most boaters are settled somewhere so it becomes unusual to see another boat on the move.</p>
<p>We came across several swing bridges that had been left down, some of which were very tricky. One was rotting and very wonky, one was locked in place and was very reluctant to be unlocked and equally resistant to being lifted. Another, in the village of Thrupp was particularly difficult. It was supposed to be operated by an electric panel with 'up', 'down' and 'stop' buttons but in reality it required one person to hold in the 'up' button whilst a second person pulled down on the arm of the bridge. With Tony at the helm, one of the wardens volunteered to pull down whilst I pressed. Unfortunately his dogs were under the other arm of the bridge so an emergency stop was required, followed by moving the dogs, re-closing the bridge and starting all over again.</p>

<p>We arrived at the next lock, about three miles from Oxford, only to find a sign telling us that this was the last chance for a boat longer than 52 feet to turn around before entering the Thames! What? We didn't know this! We won't have a licence for the Thames until January. We went through the lock, turned and came straight back through it. (That's a short sentence to describe a lengthy process!). Back the way we came, we moored at a 14 day mooring next to a tap.</p>
<p>Later that day we walked into Oxford. When we reached the lock into the Thames we discovered that we wouldn't need a Thames licence to go through this first lock so we could have turned there after all! Oh well! 
<p>We decided to stay where we were for a few days.</p>

<p>The first morning we woke to a frozen canal with ducks skating over the surface! The sun shone and the air was still; the reflections in the canal were perfect and beautiful. We prepared a picnic lunch and went for a walk along the towpath to Thrupp where we sat on a bench to watch the world go by. We investigated the church and, in order to be thorough, both canal side pubs...</p>

<p>The following day was, in contrast, very windy and wet. We spent the day on the boat, preparing her for her Christmas visitors.

<p>On the third day, the weather was much improved so we took a picnic into Oxford and explored the city.</p>

<p>Time had run out so the following day we filled up with water and moved Liberty Belle to Thrupp for the Christmas period. It is a lovely spot with wardens, facilities, a bus stop on the Banbury to Oxford route, a car park, tea room as well as the two pubs! Hoping that this would be perfect for Joe and Kirsty to start their Christmas boating adventure we gathered our things, locked Liberty Belle up, caught the bus to Oxford and took the train to Chandlers Ford.</p>
