<p>Fazeley Junction, a sort of Y-shaped junction where the Coventry Canal is joined to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal.</p>

<p>Full of encouragement, Tony offered me the chance to steer through Fazeley Junction. Thank goodness I declined. On the first attempt, Liberty Belle managed to take up the entire turning space, stern against the towpath and bow almost in the backyard of a home for the elderly. Tony managed to get her out of this embarrassing position and tried again. Somehow we ended up in exactly the same place. As we had taken up the entire junction for a while, Tony then brought her alongside the towpath to give another boat the chance to enter the junction. They glided by, going straight ahead. Tony made another attempt...</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was sent to the bow to make myself useful. I was not useful. To be friendly I chatted to two women in the bow of their boat. They were moored up outside a tap to fill their water tank. I suggested that maybe we weren't going to Birmingham after all and could they tell me what was in the other direction. They suggested a National Trust Property which they rather liked.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the business end, the men belonging to the water tap women were offering verbal help, followed up with a little physical shoving. In the end, the two gentlemen took the bow rope from me and hauled poor old Liberty Belle around so that she faced the right way. Heroic! We were going to Birmingham! At first it seemed as if nobody else was heading our way at all, we had the canal to ourselves. Maybe nobody else wanted to spend half the day turning at the junction!</p>



<p>We moored up for a coffee break and found ourselves at an old gravel pit which had been transformed into a wonderful Nature Reserve with wetlands and meadows with a backdrop of trees. The network of trails were well marked and we couldn't resist a little stroll. This completely finished my foot off for the day. I sat at a bench with Tarka and Tony walked on. I saw coots, mallards, swans, Canada geese and great crested grebes. I also saw what I thought might be a tern but probably wasn't... Apparently, on this year's official bird count day, 91 species of birds were identified! Definitely a place to return to.

<p>With the above mentioned foot I still had 7 locks to do...ouch.</p>
