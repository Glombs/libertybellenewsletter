<p>Robin and the new mattress</p>

<p>The next morning we stripped the bed and rolled up the old mattress in preparation  for the arrival of Robin, bringing us our new mattress which had been left on our doorstep the day before! It was carefully planned for the mattress to arrive whilst Tony was at home next week so that he could take it in then worry about transporting it to the boat another time. However, the plan went so wrong that it all came more right than we could have hoped. Robin planned to visit us at the weekend and was good enough to collect the abandoned (must be signed for...) mattress and bring it up to us. What a hero!</p>

<p>So, after Robin delivered the mattress from the car park next to the boat, he took his car to the housing estate and joined us on the boat. We then all went off to one of the three Wetherspoons in Coventry for a big breakfast.</p>

<p>We returned to the canal and Robin manouvered Liberty Belle under the bridge into the Coventry Basin, turned her around and brought her alongside the tow path with her nose towards the water pipe. Smoothly done, Robin! He hasn't lost the touch.</p>

<p>We tied her up tight and filled her with water ready for my long stay.</p>

<p>After this excitement  we went back into Coventry for a bit of an explore. We wandered about, making our way to the second Wetherspoons for a pint. It seemed rude to miss out the third so we found that one and had dinner!</p>

<p>Whilst we were wandering around we visited the old and the new cathedrals. The sun shone brightly into the old cathedral shell, which was mellow and beautiful. In contrast, the new one was sinister and awesome. The stained glass was a real wonder, leaving beautiful patterns on the grey walls as the sun moved around the building. The most thrilling part was a round room off to one side with tall, narrow windows, chairs set all around the edge and a central altar. Suspended above this central altar was a large white cross looking frail in contrast to the three huge metal nails protruding from it. Around this cross was an outsized crown of thorns, doubling as a light fitting...</p>

<p>Robin discovered that the acoustics of the room meant that if you stood at the alter your voice boomed as if being picked up by a microphone. We stood around the altar and took great pleasure in speaking in dramatic voice to each other, and encouraging other visitors to the room to do the same.</p>

<p>In the evening Robin and Tony went for a stroll, which took them to Aldi apparently where, it seems, they bought a pack of 4 icecreams and had to eat two each... . (This story came out gradually the next day.) As a result of the walk, Robin ended up with a sore foot, which slowed him down a lot for the rest of the weekend.

Our researcher (Mrs Helen Traviss) has discovered the following information about coconuts in canals. Excellent work!
