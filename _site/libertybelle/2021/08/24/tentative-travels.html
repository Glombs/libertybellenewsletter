<p>We were moored in Birmingham ready to welcome Cathy and Will as our first visitors for quite some time. They had expressed an interest in visiting The Black Country Museum, so we journeyed there aboard Liberty Belle, taking things gently because we hadn't had her engine repaired properly yet.</p>

<p>We moored outside the museum for a couple of nights. Unfortunately not all of the exhibits were open but we managed to entertain ourselves there for the day.</p>

<p>We travelled back to Birmingham by another route, to make the journey more interesting for our guests. We arrived just in time to have lunch in Damascena, my favourite place to eat in Brum. The following day we explored the Jewellery Quarter in the morning and then Cathy treated us to a fabulous lunch in 'Formosa Izakaya'.</p>

<p>Sadly it was then time for them to collect their luggage and make their way to the coach station for their journey home. Tony and I both set off with them to wave them off but I had forgotten my mask, so couldn't walk through The Mail Box and had to wave madly from there instead!</p>

<p>Hot on their heels were our next guests, Joe and Kirsty with Carter who arrived the following morning. We all had a little look around the city then travelled back to our usual mooring space outside the Black Country Museum. The following morning, Carter and I went off for an adventure to the local park whilst Tony, Joe and Kirsty went into the museum for a short visit.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we had decided to travel to Halesowen, which involves passing through the Netherton tunnel and turning onto the Dudley No.2 Canal, a section of the network that we hadn't done before.</p>

<p>This journey proved to be a bit more exciting than we had expected.</p>

<p>All went well, passing through the long Netherton Tunnel and then turning left onto Dudley No.2 which was a pleasant stretch with interesting artwork by local artist Luke Perry, explaining some of the local history.</p>

<p>Eventually we arrived at our second tunnel of the day, Gosty Hill. As we ventured in it became clear that the size of the tunnel varied greatly and it was such a tight fit at times that we began to have doubts about ever reaching the other end.</p>

<p>It was very nerve wracking with the tunnel closing in on us; we were in real danger of becoming wedged in. Of course, we had no phone signal down there so someone would have to swim for help..... </p>

<p>We continued our journey to the end of the navigation in Halesowen. When we arrived it became clear that there was nowhere to moor, so we had to turn around and make our way back to a space that may or may not be a legitimate place to moor and stopped there.</p>

<p>Once we were secured we went to explore Halesowen, but there was not much to see. That evening Kirsty booked us a table at The Canal House in Birmingham for the following day, presumably as incentive for us to brave the tunnel again!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony looked up some information on the Gosty Hill Tunnel. It seems that it is so notoriously tricky that any boat that passes through is entitled to purchase a brass plaque declaring "I Survived Gosty Hill Tunnel". Maybe we should have found that out beforehand. Or maybe not, otherwise we might not have attempted it!</p>

<p>First thing the next morning some fishermen arrived, intending to set themselves up where we were moored. We apologised and promised to move along as soon as we were ready. They were very chilled about it. Straight after breakfast we set off back to Gosty Hill Tunnel. The return journey was not quite as frightening now that we knew it was possible.</p>

<p>Stopping off on the way at Joe's van to load up their belongings,  we made it into Birmingham and moored up in Cambrian Wharf, in plenty of time for our meal at The Canal House. Yet again the time had passed all too quickly and Joe, Kirsty and Carter set off for home.</p>

<p>We completed a full week of good company and dining by meeting up with Julia for a long awaited catch-up and a huge lunch at Damascena. Arriving back at the boat we could only sit and admire the gift of lemon cake that Julia had given us, we were so full!</p>

<p>(Fear not, we had fully recovered by the following day and the cake quickly disappeared. Yum!)</p>

<p>We still had quite some time to wait before Liberty Belle was due at Alvechurch Marina for her repairs, so we went back to the house for a short visit then explored more of Birmingham. Tony serviced the engine and touched up some of the paintwork. We decided to trust the engine for one more short excursion with Liberty Belle, to complete some parts of the surrounding network that we had missed out before.</p>

<p>Pottering around in this relaxed manner we found ourselves getting uncharacteristically hooked into the  EURO2020 matches!</p>

<p>We were moored again in Birmingham's Gas Street Basin for one of England's earlier games and were thoroughly entertained by the noise and general jollity around us as people cheered on the team in pub gardens and on balconies around the canal. However, once we had decided it was bedtime, it was no longer quite so much fun from our point of view. </p>

<p>We managed to get to sleep,  but Tony was woken up twice to shoo people off the boat who were prancing around on the stern taking selfies. Then, at about 5 a.m. he was again woken up by Liberty Belle bumping against something. The something turned out to be the opposite bank of the canal. Some fun loving joker had decided to undo one of our ropes and let us loose...</p>

<p>By now it was time to set off for Alvechurch to get Liberty Belle's engine sorted out.</p>

<p>As well as the engine mounts, Tony had given a short list of other things he thought should be attended to.
We were booked in for a full week because the marina is also a hire company, so the engineer would attend to us when he could but might have to drop everything to rescue a customer on one of their fleet. However, we were hoping that the work would be finished within a couple of days.</p>

<p>On the way we passed through Wast Hill tunnel and met 5 boats going through in the opposite direction! After hardly seeing any boats moving for quite some time, this was rather a shock!</p>

</figure>

<p>The work began on Wednesday and the engine mounts were replaced successfully but that left the other little jobs, so work continued on Thursday...</p>

<p>Although the engineer had ordered all the parts required ahead of time, one of them had been the wrong size, so he had re-ordered it and it was due later that day.</p>

<p>When this part did arrive, it too was wrong. As the engineer and Tony were discussing this it came to light that the engineer wasn't aware of one of the jobs Tony had requested, so he was another part short. The two parts were ordered from a different supplier and were due on Friday.</p>

<p>Friday arrived. The parts were delivered but the weather forecast was for heavy rain, so Liberty Belle (without a working engine) was punted into the painting 'shed', (with an accompanying beautiful rendering of "O Sole Mio"...), so that the engineer would be able to work despite the weather.</p>

<p>Once we were inside, another boat joined us and we were surprised to see that it was Nick &amp; Margaret's "Theodora"! We had met them way back at the beginning of our Adventure in Stratford On Avon and had been in touch since. We contacted them and discovered that Theodora had been there for some time, having a new paint job and they were not due to pick her up until after we had left, so that was a shame.</p>

<p>After a little overtime on Friday, Liberty Belle was ready, so, on the Saturday, we were released! Thank goodness. Now we could travel around with confidence.</p>

<p>We needed to get to Tamworth, where we had a hire car booked on Wednesday. We were going to fetch Mary for a long awaited holiday on board.</p>

<p>It was a journey of 26 miles and 38 locks. We set off from the boatyard and did 11 of the miles on Saturday, mooring up in Birmingham where Tony put everything back into the engine bay that had been living in the front well whilst the work was being done.  We also got a bit of housework and some shopping done.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday we did a record breaking 11 miles and 34 locks, leaving the short journey of 4 miles and 4 locks on Monday, and we were there. As luck would have it we were able to moor in exactly the place we had hoped, near a convenient place to load and unload the hire car.</p>

<p>Having plenty of time before collecting the car on Wednesday we were able to have a good nose around the area and find a place to get fish and chips when we arrived back with Mary, because there would be no time to cook. (Good excuse, eh?)</p>

<p>Next we will be heading for the Lancaster Canal, our finale with Liberty Belle before we part with her and she goes on to have another adventure with new owners.</p>
