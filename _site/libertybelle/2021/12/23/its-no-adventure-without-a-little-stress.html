 <p>Well, let's just hope we get plenty of warning.....!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Moored in Selby Basin, just outside the lock, we were due to pass through onto the tidal River Ouse at 7:30, so were up and ready early. We shared the lock with another boat and we let them go in front of us, giving us a chance to see how they fared first. The disadvantage was that they travelled slower than we wanted to go.</p>

<p>Being so close behind them, Tony was able to see that their boat ended up well over to the right bank when passing a tributary joining on the left.</p>

<p>Assuming that the force of the water had pushed them over, Tony steered Liberty Belle towards the left bank to counteract the effect, only to find that the water also pushed to the left! EEEEK! Skilfully, Tony got us back on course and avoided hitting the tree and the bank. Phew!</p>

<p>Eventually we arrived, unscathed, at Naburn lock. Back on calm water, we started to wonder whether York would be busy....there seemed to be a lot of large cruisers around.</p>

<p>Luckily there was plenty of mooring space in the prime position outside the Museum Gardens.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of that day wandering around York, getting a feel for the place. We were delighted to see a Peregrine Falcon land on one of the minster's crockets.</p>

<p>We celebrated with a delicious pint in The Shambles Inn, which was a lovely finish to the day.</p>

<p>The following morning we joined a free walking tour of York, which was extremely good - an informative two hours, well delivered and pitched just right.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we walked the walls and explored the museum gardens. We treated ourselves to a delicious meal in "The Yak and Yeti" - golly, Nepalese potato salad is good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we spoilt our otherwise perfect day by having cold showers, because we hadn't run the engine at all to heat up the water. Oh well.</p>

<p>The next morning, getting ready to set off for Ripon, we saw some scullers on the river. Our least favourite craft to share the water with. Please, please choose a sport where you face the way you are going! Is that too much to ask? We set off at 8 and were on full alert but, thankfully, didn't come across them.</p>

<p>Having a sandwich on the go, we managed to get all the way to Ripon, with the fairly short length locks causing us no hassle.</p>

<p>On the way we saw Sand Martins darting in and out of their holes in the bank, as well as a Kingfisher, some Little Egrets and some Lapwings.</p>

<p>Sadly, on exiting one of the locks, we spotted a House Martin that had somehow ended up in the water and was struggling to fly up out of it. There was nothing we could do.</p>

<p>Ripon. Oh, we like Ripon. It is the smallest city in Yorkshire (and the third smallest in the country) and has the feeling of a market town.</p>

<p>After a delicious fish and chip supper we went for a pint whilst we waited for the Wake Ceremony which has taken place every evening for 1135 years, since the time of King Alfred.</p>

<p>The Wakeman, (or one of the Wakemen, as there are three nowadays, to share the duty), sounds his ceremonial horn in the direction of each of the four corners of the town square to signify that it is safe for the citizens to retire because he is now on watch, looking out for Viking invaders. Good man!</p>

 <p>"Let's walk to Fountains Abbey" says Tony, "It's only three miles away".</p>
 <p>Unfortunately the path was being renovated and there was a diversion....unmarked of course.</p>
 <p>Some considerable time later we finally had a distant view of it. </p>
 <p>Oh well, it was a lovely day!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ripon was the end of the line, so, having explored the town, we turned Liberty Belle around and headed back to York. On the way here we were heading uphill with the lump of stone that is the lock cill underneath Liberty Belle's narrow and pert prow. However, going downhill was a different story. Her rear end is somewhat larger and lower in the water....Things were a bit tight but not too bad until we reached Westwick Lock. Once the lock was empty, Liberty Belle was sandwiched between the cill and one of the front gates, (which open inwards). I opened the other gate to let her out but her prow was pointing into the corner and couldn't swing free.</p>

<p>I could close the gates, re-fill the lock and Liberty Belle could reverse out, turn and then re-enter backwards....
Before going to those lengths, Tony tried to create enough wriggle room by lifting the rear button fender (that bounces Liberty Belle off cills and such that would otherwise damage the rudder), and used the boathook to ease her out of the lock. It worked!</p>

<p>That was quite stressful.</p>

<p>The next lock wasn't quite as troublesome, so just the Linton Lock now lay between us and York. Unfortunately we misinterpreted the 'All Craft This Way' sign and went straight past the lock, heading for the weir. Now, this shouldn't really have been a problem, in fact this section of the river is lined with moored boats, so is safe enough, we just had to turn back...</p>

<p>However, the wind was very strong, and, combined with the pull of the water, it was too much for Liberty Belle. In our desperate attempt to salvage the situation we were being blown towards the moored boats. More stress! Tony did manage to save us from being swept against the edge of the weir but not without a minor collision.</p>

<p>The man on the stern of the narrrowboat was watching this all unfold, which didn't help our stress levels....he, however, looked remarkably calm. We apologised profusely, hoping that he would sympathise with our plight, rather than tell us what idiots we were for moving in these conditions.... He simply said "Don't worry, it's not my boat".</p>

<p>Eventually we were successfully through the final lock and back in York without further incident. The moorings in York were much busier, with lots of cruisers there for the weekend, but we slipped into the last spot, near the railway. What a relief.</p>

<p>We spent Saturday enjoying York then set off early on Sunday morning, before the scullers arrived, to wait outside Naburn Lock for our passage back along the tidal section of the River Ouse. We went for coffee and cake in a new vegan cafe based in the old banqueting hall alongside the lock. The new owner of the building chatted to us about all her plans for activities, clubs and events for the local community in her premises.</p>

<p>I really hope the recent restrictions and all the hardships that the pandemic has caused haven't ruined her plans and taken the wind out of her sails - people will really benefit from her ideas, if they become reality.</p>

<p>Setting off we saw a Kingfisher, which never fails to make us smile.</p>

<p>Travelling against the flow of the tide, it seemed like a long three hours, avoiding the branches and logs heading towards us. To top it all, a water skier zoomed past us, creating such a huge wash that I nearly lost my footing! That'll teach me to concentrate instead of taking photos!</p>

<p>We arrived at Selby Lock just as the tide was turning, so, having been against the tide all the way, as Tony steered Liberty Belle around to enter the lock, we were against the tide again! The lock keeper, standing at the entrance, gave helpful signals to Tony and all was well.</p>

<p>Apparently we had made very good time, considering the conditions.</p>

<p>Well, that was quite an adventure!. We moored in Selby Basin for the night. Ahead of us was the Huddersfield Canal and the low, narrow Standedge Tunnel with its tight bends... Tony had measured and re-measured Liberty Belle but still wasn't sure we could get through.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p class="greeting">Merry Christmas Everyone!</p>

<p>Golly, August was a while ago, wasn't it? Sorry it is taking me so long to send reports of our adventures. There seems to be such a lot to do, moving back into the house.</p>

<p>We hope you are all well and can find your own little piece of joy this festive season.</p>

<p class="greeting">Much love from Tony and Rachel.</p>
