<p>Liberty Belle waited at Fazeley Junction for us to fetch Mary in a hire car. We arrived back to find the boat just as we had left her, which is always a relief. Tony took back the car whilst Mary and I went to fetch our much anticipated fish and chips. It didn't disappoint.</p>

<p>Our plan was to take Mary on a trip along the River Trent and the River Witham to reach Boston, but with a few diversions on the way.</p>

<p>This part of the network involves the tidal sections of the River Trent which can only be attempted when the tide is high enough. The locks entering and leaving these sections must be booked ahead with the lock keepers who operate the locks, count you onto the river and count you off again, as well as supervising your entry into and exit from the fast flowing, deep water.... </p>

<p>Moving out of flowing water to turn at right angles into a lock mouth is very unnerving, even with a lock keeper standing on the wall miming instructions!</p>

<p>To get to the River Trent we needed to turn onto the Coventry Canal and follow it until it joined the Trent and Mersey which would then take us to the junction of the rivers Trent and Soar.</p>

<p>Once our lunch in Fazeley was over, we set off along the Coventry Canal to Lichfield. Well, as close as you can get by boat, which is a couple of miles outside the town.</p>

<p>All three of us know Lichfield. Tony and I have been there on Liberty Belle and Mary's sister lived there for some years. We decided that we would like to go and spend some time there, if the weather looked ok for the walk, which it was, so off we went.</p>

<p>We couldn't go inside the Cathedral immediately because there was a ceremony in full swing involving local dignitaries, so we hung around outside for a bit, but it was worth the wait.</p>

<p>We had lunch in a local cafe, then, suitably fortified, wandered back to the boat. We moved on to Fradley Junction to moor for the night, which was very busy with boats, as it was last time we were there.</p>

<p>We had a little wander around Fradley Pool Nature Reserve. The lake was originally built as a reservoir to feed the canal, in the 1780s.</p>

<p>From Fradley we turned onto the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal as far as Alrewas where we moored and had a wander around in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Leaving Alrewas, Tony steered Liberty Belle, Mary walked ahead along the towpath and I did the locks. There was a noisy road running alongside this section of the Trent and Mersey, replaced eventually by a railway track along which very long and heavy goods trains ran in the early hours, (apparently..... ).</p>

<p>Despite that it was pretty with the yellows of earlier in the year now replaced by pale roses, blackberry flowers and meadowsweet with the occasional purple vetch peeping out.</p>

<p>We stopped at Burton on Trent and had a wander into town but there was disappointingly little to see, so we moved on to Willington.</p>

<p>Our first little diversion from our main route was a short trip down the Upper Trent as far as Cavendish Bridge. As we approached the end of the navigable section of the river, several people on the bank shouted to us not to go under the bridge in front of us. We already knew that we couldn't do that but had seen a section just before the bridge on the opposite bank which may or may not have been moorings, so we shouted back, asking about mooring. All responses were negative.</p>

<p>With difficulty, because of the water flow, Tony turned Liberty Belle and we left the way we had come. Rejoining the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal, we finally moored in Sawley.</p>

<p>Rather than go straight onto the River Trent from Sawley Lock, our plan was to turn south onto the River Soar first and head to Loughborough.</p>

<p>We had already been there with Liberty Belle but had approached from the south and arrived just as both the rivers Soar and Trent went into flood so we hadn't gone beyond Loughborough. Now was our chance to fill in the gap.</p>

<p>On our way we saw swallows, house martins and sand martins swooping down to the water and I attempted (yet again) to try and distinguish between them as they darted around us. Tony's patience with my questions on flora and fauna appears to be infinite....</p>

<p>We moored in Loughborough Basin for the night and took Mary to see the sights the following morning. Tony and I are rather fond of the town, having been forced to spend so much time there, but really, a morning is all you need for sightseeing. So, after lunch we headed back along the river, the way we had come.</p>

<p>Arriving back at the junction of the Soar and Trent, we continued north for our next diversion onto the Erewash Canal. We had heard discouraging stories of the Erewash. Not many people travel along it because the locks are so difficult to operate.</p>

<p>We met a boater who had been living on his boat for 15 years and had never attempted the Erewash because of the stories he had heard and he wished us luck with it. We decided that we would attempt it and turn around if it proved to be beyond our capabilities.</p>

<p>Beside the first lock was a pub. One of the customers called out to me that I would have muscles like Popeye by the time I had finished the journey.</p>

<p>We soldiered on and managed to complete the 4 locks to our first mooring in Sandiacre without too much difficulty, then 6 more to Ilkeston.</p>

<p>Finally we completed the last 5 locks and arrived at the end of the canal at Langley Mill. What was the problem? The canal was absolutely delightful and the locks had been no more difficult to use than most others around the country.

<p>On arrival in the basin we were encouraged to moor outside the boaters' services, alongside the water tap, which seemed very wrong but was apparently the norm for visiting boats. They get so few of them that we were unlikely to be disturbed.</p>

<p>The return journey we did in one day, all 14 locks back to Trent Lock. Before leaving we promised one of the CRT volunteers that we would spread the word that the Erewash locks were no more difficult than on any other stretch of canal and was well worth visiting.</p>


<p>Like most canals it fell into disuse and was almost lost to us but in this case it was saved and restored by the Erewash Canal Preservation and Development Association, (ECPDA), formed in 1967 and still going strong.</p> 

<p>Not without opposition though. One councillor wanted it filled in and is quoted as saying " the hump back bridge over the canal causes unnecessary expenditure of energy to those walking to the local hostelry"!</p> 

<p>One of the ways the association fought back was to organise a Pie and Peas Cruise every winter from the pub which battles through even when the canal is frozen!</p>

<p>Leaving the Erewash, we joined the River Trent briefly but turned off again, this time onto the Nottingham &amp; Beeston Canal, mooring for the night at Castle Meadow in Nottingham.</p>

<p>We treated ourselves to lunch out in Nottingham and then had a look around.</p>

<p>Mary knows Nottingham as she used to work in Boots the Chemists there, but the city has changed a bit since then and is even now undergoing more changes. There were hoardings and barriers up, holes being dug, old buildings being demolished and new ones under construction.</p>

<p>After Nottingham we went back onto the river for a two day journey to Cromwell Tidal Lock, for which we had a booking, pausing at Hazelford Ferry and Newark on the way.</p>

<p>Stopping at Newark proved to be tricky. The mooring was on the right hand side just beyond a large, multi-arched bridge. Tony attempted to pass through the right-hand arch but the water flow was too strong and he had to reverse hard to prevent a collision with the bridge.</p>

<p>On the second attempt he went through the middle arch instead, turning in a wide arc to face the water flow, with another boat approaching mid-manoeuvre. With the water flow against him he had to drive hard back towards the bridge and into the mooring space.</p>

<p>Heart in mouth we made it and waved a thank you to the other boat who had waited patiently for us to sort ourselves out.</p>

<p>We had a little look around and ran a few errands before setting off again and mooring in front of Cromwell Lock to wait for our passage the following morning.</p>

 <p>We were going to moor against the wall but sandmartins were nesting in holes where the shuttering bolts were missing, so we joined the other boats at the pontoon.</p>

<p>At Cromwell Lock, the owner of one of the other waiting boats had only had it for a week and was taking it to Sheffield where she works. She had a friend coming the following morning to provide moral support for her trip on the tidal bit of the Trent to Torksey. A tricky bit of the network to attempt as a novice!</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. the following morning we were all released through Cromwell Lock onto the river. We chugged along, not really noticing the tidal movement until we tried to turn off the river into Torksey Lock, where we suddenly felt the water dragging us away.</p>

<p>We were pleased and relieved to be on a canal again. This time a Roman built one, the Foss Dyke. We stopped for lunch then carried on to Saxilby despite the warning from another boater that we might not find a mooring there.</p>

<p>It was too hot to just sit in the boat so moving along seemed to be the best option. We were lucky and did find a mooring, very close to a shop selling delicious local ice cream from Blyton's in Gainsborough. Ideal!</p>

<p>Our next stop was at the services just outside Lincoln. Tony pottered off on foot to check out the mooring situation and paid for us to stay at one of the visitor pontoons in Brayford Pool.</p>

<p>This expanse of water is a widening of the River Witham, used as a port by the Romans who connected it to the River Trent by constructing Foss Dyke; "What have the Romans ever done for us?".</p>

<p>The 'pool' is maintained and preserved by the Brayford Trust charity on a not-for-profit basis, so we were happy to pay to stay there.</p>

<p>When Mary was stationed at RAF Waddington she was involved in the parade through the streets of Lincoln, when they were first bestowed the Freedom of the City.</p>

<p>I hoped that meant she was allowed to walk along with her bayonet fixed, but apparently not. How disappointing.</p>

<p>After our stay in Lincoln, we continued on the River Witham to Boston via Tattershall. Boston was a pleasant surprise. An old market town which, compared to some places we had seen on our travels lately, looks quite smart.</p>

<p>After lunch we walked into town and visited the Stump, or, to give it its official title, the Church of St Botolph. This is a lovely, bright building which has impressive dimensions for a parish church.</p>

<p>The tower itself is one of the tallest Medieval towers in the country at over 80 metres, higher than the church is long. It looks impressive from a distance but it isn't until you stand right next to it that you can appreciate its height.</p>

<p>The market square was lined with some lovely old buildings of differing styles, some with Dutch gables. The next morning was market day, so we  went along to see what we could find. Mary bought a few items of food to take back home with her and we found a pleasant cafe for coffee and cake.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>I must apologise for my slow progress lately; I am now two months behind on my newsletters. As Joe recently pointed out, they no longer qualify as newsletters, being more like historical documents.</p>

<p>Our travels have been less leisurely of late, so time to sit and compose has become more difficult to find.</p>

<p>At the moment we are heading towards the Lancaster Canal for our booking across the Ribble Link on Wednesday.</p>

<p>We still plan to sell Liberty Belle soon and should be returning to the house before the end of October.</p>
