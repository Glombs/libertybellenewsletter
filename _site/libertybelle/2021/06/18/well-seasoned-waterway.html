 <p>Approaching The Anderton Boat Lift from the Weaver Navigation.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We made it to Anderton in plenty of time for our trip down in the boat lift. We had filled our water tank at the facilities, moored overnight and were ready and waiting at the designated mooring, chatting to our fellow travellers and reading the information board. One of the notices informed us that, from a certain date, it was no longer necessary to book passage through the locks on the river but they had specific opening times which were detailed.</p>

<p>That was good news, it made travelling easier if we didn't have to get through to someone on the phone before arriving at each lock, we could just turn up.</p>

<p> member of staff came along to greet us with safety information for our trip in the lift. She informed us that we would be expected to contact each lock keeper in turn to book our passage through. Tony pointed out the poster behind her and she seemed slightly confused but no explanation was given. We decided that the dated, printed version was probably correct.</p>

<p>The lift consists of two water troughs supported on hydraulic rams. Originally the hydraulic tubes were filled with canal water, counterbalanced each other and were powered by steam engine. After several closures due to problems with corrosion the pistons were filled with distilled water. This delayed the corrosion but it remained a problem.</p>

<p>Later the lift was altered to work using a system of ropes, pulleys and counterweights, each trough working independently and with electricity supplying the power. A stronger frame was built around the original to take the weight of all this equipment. The lift could now be repaired when necessary by closing one trough at a time, keeping the waterways open and saving money.</p>

<p>By the 1970's, due to the decline in canal traffic, the lift was only used for pleasure boats. Then, in 1983 it was declared unsafe and closed.</p>

<p>In 2002 it was reopened after being restored. Again it was hydraulic but this time using oil rather than water and keeping the troughs independent. Now it has both frames still in place as well as the redundant overhead pulleys. The counterweights have been removed and used to build a maze in the visitor centre's garden.</p>

<p>Travelling down in the lift is quite an event. Looking at the construction it is difficult to see immediately which parts are currently responsible for the operation so the untrained eye doesn't know where to settle. Add to this the need for looking at the view and, despite it being such a slow process, it's hard to know quite what happened!</p>

<p>When we arrived at the first lock, the lock keeper expressed surprise because he hadn't been expecting us and gave us the phone numbers to use to book ahead..... Good grief.</p>

<p>From then on, we phoned ahead to book passage through each of the locks. There were very few boats moving around so we didn't have to wait around for other boats to join us which often happens on rivers. Some of the locks are electrically operated but others are manual. Given the size of the gates, working them must take quite an effort.</p>

<p>The lock keepers were very cheerful and welcoming but during the course of our conversations they expressed their frustration with poor communication, changing responsibilities and lack of staff. It seems that things in the CRT garden are not all rosy.</p>

<p>In summary, the history of the industry around the River Weaver goes something like this:-</p>

<p class="quote">The surrounding area has always been associated with salt. Brine percolates naturally to the surface in places where it dries out and forms crusts of salt. The Romans exploited this valuable resource and eventually mines were sunk to extract it straight from the ground.</p>

<p class="quote">In 1734 the Weaver Navigation was built, following the course of the river, giving a navigable route for transporting salt to the world via the River Mersey. By 1777 the Trent and Mersey Canal, (built by Brindley for Wedgwood to transport his crockery safely), was completed. Initially, salt was transfered from Trent and Mersey boats to Weaver Navigation boats via chutes at Anderton. To enable boats to travel between the river and the canal, the boat lift was built, opening in 1875.</p>

<p class="quote">There are several swing bridges over the river (too tall for us to worry about). Two of them in Northwich date back to 1899 and were the first electrically operated swing bridges in Britain.</p>

<p class="quote">The Winsford Salt Mine dates back to 1844 when prospectors were searching for coal and established a salt mine instead. Eventually, too much salt was being produced so in 1888 The Salt Union was formed to control the market. The Winsford mine was forced to close in 1892 but, in 1928, it was re-opened when the last of the Northwich mines was flooded. The salt is still being mined here but interestingly they have also found a use for the resultant, ever growing, network of underground caverns. With the constant temperature and humidity levels together with the lack of UV light, vermin and water, excellent storage space is available for valuables including paintings and historical documents. Brilliant!</p>

<p class="quote">In 1873, making use of this local supply of salt, the Brunner Mond chemical works was established on the banks of the Weaver. In 1926, combined with three other businesses, it became ICI,  then broke away again to re-form Brunner Mond in 1991.</p>

<p>The first town we visited was Frodsham, a traditional market town not far from Runcorn. From the top of the sandstone hill behind the town you can see the River Weaver, The Weaver Navigation, The River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal.</p>

<p>The delightful town of Northwich has many buildings which, on first glance look Tudor in origin but are, in fact, much more recent timber-framed buildings. The mines under Northwich became uneconomical to dig during the 19th century so the owners pumped water through the mines instead and extracted the salt from the resultant brine. This caused the land to subside.</p>

<p>The timber-framed buildings, designed by Victorians, can to be jacked up when the land below them sinks. I was amazed that we hadn't heard about them before!</p>

<p>On our travels along the river, we spotted a heron colony. We were unable to count the nests but a passer by told us that the year before there had been 35 of them. He also told us of a rumour of a kingfisher nearby but sadly we didn't see it. We hadn't seen a kingfisher since we were moored at Westport Lake in Stoke!</p>

<p>One morning we were running low on water and had plans to fill up as soon as we saw a tap but managed to cruise straight past one on the approach to a lock, simply because we were expected and the keeper had the gates open ready to welcome us. Once we were through we realised what we had done and hoped to be able to fill up at the facilities at the next town. We knew that repairs were underway there but hoped that we would still be able to use the tap.</p>

<p>When we got there, it was busy with high-vis people but it looked as if we would be able to use the tap once they and their workboat were gone, so we hatched a plan to get up early and use it before the workmen returned the following morning. It turns out that these people get up very early, so we missed our chance!</p>

<p>Hoping we would find water later in the day, we waited until the next lock was manned at 10 a.m. and Tony rang them to book passage, but there was no answer. By this time the men working on the facilities opposite us had moved their boat so that it was straddling the canal in front of us. We walked over to talk to them from the bridge above. No notice had been given for a closure to navigation so surely they wouldn't be long.... Apparently they were laying electric cables and, if all went well, would be about 2 hours....</p>

<p>Tony decided that, all things considered, we might as well turn around, return to the lock behind us, go through, fill up with water and come back. He phoned the lock keeper and booked passage both ways.</p>

<p>By the time we got back, the workboat was out of the way and we progressed to the next lock, despite still not having got through to the keeper. The lock keepers were on the look out for boats and opened up, telling us that they didn't have a working phone, so we wouldn't have got through, however many times we tried.</p>

<p>We did manage to ring the keeper of the next lock but we were too late that day to pass through, so we moored on the pontoon as he suggested and went through as soon as it opened at 10 am the next morning.</p>

<p>That evening we moored at the end of the navigation in the lovely Winsford Flash, where there was a tap which wasn't marked on either of the maps of the river that we had. A very welcome surprise find.</p>

<p>After an enjoyable 6 days, we returned to the boat lift to ascend back onto the Trent and Mersey Canal. We were joined by another boat and travelled up side by side. The other boat was having trouble with his horn, so he asked us to go out first.</p>

<p>There is a sharp turn when rejoining the canal so sounding a horn is important. Unfortunately, our brand new horn also failed to work and we crept around the corner in silence.... Luckily there was no-one coming, so we got away with it!</p>

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">[1]</sup>
We have a battery powered alarm clock that is set to 7 o’clock. We hadn’t realised how much time it was losing due to a low battery. On this occasion it went off at what it thought was 7 in the evening, although, in reality it was half past six in the morning…. 
We had until 8 o’clock before it was a decent hour to run our engine and move.

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>As I write this we are waiting at the boatyard for repairs to be completed;</p>
<p>(a story for another day). </p>
<p>We have been here for several days now and the novelty has rather worn off.</p>
<p>Still, we have the football to keep us entertained....Yes, it really has come to that!</p>
