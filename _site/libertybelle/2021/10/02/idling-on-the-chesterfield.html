<p>We arrived back in Boston on Monday 19th July to find Liberty Belle waiting patiently on the pontoon. We set off from there and followed the River Witham and Foss Dyke back to Torksey Lock, hoping to be let out again onto the River Trent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The weather was hot and the water was covered in duck weed and fairy moss. We saw grebes, heron, terns and cormorants, as well as the usual ducks, moorhen and swans. There were pink swathes of campion and willow-herb interspersed with meadow-sweet. Relief from the heat came in the form of big, fat raindrops sounding like a very slow handclap on the roof of the boat.</p>

<p>Tony contacted the lock keeper at Torksey to book our passage. He was told that the tides were a bit awkward, so we should go through the lock on the Tuesday evening and moor on the pontoon immediately beyond the lock until 2pm on Wednesday, before heading off along the river. Complicated stuff.</p>

<p>We didn't stop in Lincoln on the way back but we did draw into the side of the Foss Dyke Canal in Saxilby. I jumped off the boat and raced over the bridge to the shops. A man sitting on a bench alongside the moorings queried my rush. I explained that I was dashing to the ice cream shop. Seeing that Tony wasn't tying up the boat he suggested that he might go and leave me behind. I told the man that if that happened he could have Tony's ice-cream. He was disappointed, when I returned with two cones, that Tony was still there waiting!</p>

<p>When we arrived at Torksey Lock we found that there were so many boats waiting outside that it was difficult to find somewhere to moor. The first lock-load of boats went in and things seemed a bit heated with some frustration and angry shouting, the whole process seeming to take rather longer than necessary. We were curious but kept our heads down and thought it best not to get involved.</p>

<p>Eventually they all left the lock, it was refilled and it was our turn along with another narrow boat and some cruisers. This time things proceded smoothly; down we went and out we popped. The space on the pontoon was tight, there were so many of us mooring there overnight, so we doubled up with the other narrow boat.</p>

<p>Comparing notes, it came to light that the boaters had slightly differing ideas on what time we were meant to set off from the pontoon into the river flow on Wednesday. So, we checked again with the Lock keeper first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>The boats travelling north on the river to Stockwith Lock on the Chesterfield Canal (that's us), were again told to leave at 2pm, but those heading south to Cromwell Lock were to leave earlier. The water would be high enough for us to travel by 2pm and we would go with the flow of the outgoing tide, arriving at Cromwell Lock at the turn of the tide (4:30), enabling us to turn into the lock at slack water. (I think...)</p>

<p>During the wait, Tony and I settled down to get some jobs done. Meanwhile we spotted a mink on the bank opposite the boat and a kingfisher flew past a couple of times. During the night the water level had gone down creating some interesting glooping noises around the boat and exposing a lot of mud.</p>

<p>During the morning the mud gradually disappeared again as we were lifted with the tide. The boat numbers decreased as some headed for Cromwell Lock, leaving an increasingly fidgety set of skippers behind on the pontoon. Soon boats began to leave, far too early. Our fellow narrow boater could wait no longer and off she went.</p>

<p>So, at 13:45, finding ourselves on our own, we also jumped the gun and set off.</p>

<p>As instructed, Tony phoned the Stockwith lockeeper as we travelled through Gainsborough. We were told that we were ahead of ourselves, the tide wasn't right yet and there were a lot of boats waiting so we were advised to slow down.</p>

<p>When we finally arrived at the lock, one of the cruisers ahead of us was bobbing around near the entrance, so we tried to do the same. It came to light that we had slowed down a bit too much and had missed the slack tide, so now the water flow had turned and was against us. Narrowboats are not designed to remain stationary on moving water.</p>

<p>The tide and the skipper fought each other for control of Liberty Belle, each one gaining and losing in turn. Eventually, after half an hour of this tussle, the lock gates opened and the cruiser entered the lock in a twisty, tossy, twitchy, second attempt sort of way. Then it was our turn. The water had pulled us a bit too close to the side, so Tony had to try and get further into the middle of the river before he could attempt the sharp left turn into the lock.</p>

<p>I desperately tried to help by tensing all my muscles and gripping the boat with my hands and feet. My knuckles turned white. I dared not turn around and look at Tony. I kept my eyes fixed on the lock keeper. Liberty Belle was being forced by the current towards the upstream wall of the lock but Tony managed to touch her nose against the opposite wall and the lock keeper shouted advice. Between them Tony and the lock keeper got us in there. Phew.</p>

<p>After we had moored up we went for a post-trauma pint in the Waterside Inn, overlooking the basin, and a walk along the nearby River Idle to release the tension.</p>

<p>It had all gone well. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>We were curious to see the River Idle because it is meant to be navigable, as long as you give the Environment Agency 48 hours notice because they need to raise the sluice gate to let you through.</p>

<p>The sluice gates looked formidable and the river seemed to be in a culvert without much of a view, so we weren't tempted.</p>

<p>We set off the next morning, pleased to be on a canal again.</p>

<p>The Chesterfield Canal is rural and pretty with clear water through which you can see that it is teaming with fish - we noted rudd, perch and pike but there were probably others.</p>

<p>The fields alongside the canal had ripe wheat, flowering beans and whispy oats, as well as fields of cows. The air smelt alternately of honey and things stirred up from the bottom of the canal - quite a contrast.</p>

<p>During our time there we didn't see much in the way of birdlife but we did see a mink chasing a rat in the water and a grass snake curled up on one of the piles of weed that had been dragged from the canal and dumped on the bank.</p>

<p>There are lots of shallow locks, some of them double or treble staircases, (locks, which share middle gates and feed directly one into another). However, some of the paddles weren't operating and there was a shortage of water, (it was about 10 inches down), both of which made progress slow.</p>

<p>As we pottered along we met lots of friendly people enjoying the canal in the sunshine who stopped for a chat.</p>

<p>At one lock there were a few people relaxing, including a young man, smoking weed. He politely asked if we would leave the lock full for him so that he could swim in it. We were going uphill so that would be the natural state of the lock when we left, so, having warned him of the dangers of getting stuck in the silt at the bottom of a lock we did indeed, leave it full.</p>

<p>One morning we managed to complete 24 locks before lunch, helped by friendly member of the Chesterfield Canal Trust. He explained that the lack of water was caused by some work being carried out at the top of the canal, temporarily preventing the feeder canal from supplying enough water.</p>

<p>On our journey we stopped off in Retford which is a pleasant town with some old buildings and a beautiful public park with the River Idle flowing gently through it. There were plenty of people around, making good use of the park's secluded gardens, open fields, shady trees, play areas and of course, the river.</p>

<p>There was a dam across, forming a shallow paddling section and a slightly deeper area where people of all ages were swimming and cooling off in the sunshine. There was also a large field with a substantial covered stage and a sloping grassy bank. What a wonderful resource.</p>

<p>We reached the end of the navigation. Well, not quite. We reached the final turning space on the Chesterfield Canal and moored. In order to claim the brass plaque declaring completion of the canal, you have to cruise to the end (and have photographic evidence) then reverse back to the turning space. This seemed to us to be a step too far.</p>

<p>Instead we walked the final stretch of canal and went to explore Wales.</p>

<p>We were surprised too, but we weren't lost, it turns out to be the name of an old mining town, now with a large public park built where the colliery used to be. The park was very pleasant with some boards erected explaining the history of the place.</p>

<p>One in particular showed the instructions given to new miners explaining, in comical detail, how to use the facilities at the bath house - where to deposit work clothes and clean clothes and how not to lose your soap!<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> </p>

<p>A park doesn't employ people like a colliery does, so consequently the town itself was very run down.</p>

<p>Whilst still moored at the end we decided to walk back along the canal towards Worksop hoping to see a horse drawn barge that had been advertised for that day in a leaflet given to us by the lock keeper at Stockwith. We took a small picnic and headed in the direction of the pub where the horse and barge were due to set off from.</p>

<p>Sadly there was no sign of the horse or anyone waiting for it to happen, so we assumed it had been cancelled and everyone knew but us and the lock keeper! We enjoyed the walk though and it gave us a chance to explore Worksop and have a canal-side beer to complement our picnic.</p>

<p>After our walk, returning to Liberty Belle, we came across another boat that had been moored at the end, near us but was now at the moorings a little further down. The skipper was on the phone, complaining about the lack of water in the canal, presumably to the Canal &amp; River Trust. Oh heck.</p>

<p>We decided that it would be a good idea to move our boat too, just in case we ended up stranded here, in the mud - we needed to run the engine for hot water anyway. We hoped to get through a lock or two before the end of the day. As we approached the top lock we met a CRT man who asked us to stop there whilst he checked the water situation. On his return he requested that we stay there until the pounds below us were refilled the following day. Oh well.</p>

<p>As it turned out, we waited all the following morning. We went for a walk and discovered that the pounds were in a similar state from when we had come up, low but not desperately so....</p>

<p>When the promised CRT man turned up we recognised him as lock keeper who had seen us through the Stockwith Lock. He eventually gave us the go-ahead and we found that he had kindly left all the locks in our favour. With a team effort we made reasonable progress.</p>

<p>Arriving at a small collection of houses between the locks we were pleasantly surprised to see a man with a windlass setting the next lock for us. How kind! It turned out to be one of the residents whose house is regularly in danger of flooding when boats come down the flight. He was letting some water through the lock instead of bailing out his cellar!</p>

<p>It was a two day journey from there to get back to Stockwith, where we were expected for our booking through the lock back onto the river on 29th July. To focus our minds on getting there Tony booked us a table for dinner at 5pm on 28th in The Hart Inn, Stockwith for pie night!</p>

<p>On the way, we came across the boat we had moored up against at Torksey Lock's pontoon. She and her friend on another boat had moored up at a lock landing, giving Tony nowhere to drop me off to work the lock. It was still early so we thought they might not have seen us so I went to the front of the boat, Tony brought Liberty Belle's nose forward to touch the gate and I managed to climb out onto the lock.</p>

<p>The woman on the boat realised what was happening and was very apologetic. They had been told they would get mooring there but only the lock landing was available. They had hoped to move on before anyone came along. To make up for causing us difficulty she helped to work the lock for us, so we forgave her.</p>

<p>Pie night was a success, with friendly, chatty locals at the next table, excellent beer brewed on the premises and delicious home made pies at extremely good prices. The landlord stressed that the pandemic had cost his business dear and he couldn't take another hit of any kind, so he might have to give up. We hope not.</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening but Tony woke up the next morning to the stress of the impending trip on the Trent to Keadby. We were booked in for 12:30, so he had all morning to think about it and couldn't settle to anything.</p>

<p>As it turned out the turning of the tide was later than predicted and we had to wait for 2 boats travelling from Keadby to come up in the lock before we would be let down. We went to watch them come along the river with the lock keeper (now quite familiar to us) and another boating couple.</p>

<p>The wind was strong. The lock keeper and other boaters were discussing the strength of it. The other people due to travel with us had cancelled because of the weather. We watched the two narrow boats struggle to turn into the lock. Golly, it looked choppy!</p>

<p>At last it was our turn. There was wind and there were waves. Liberty Belle's propeller buzzed whenever it left the water as we rose and fell in the waves, but all was well, her engine did us proud as we ploughed on through.</p>

<p>It was hard to see the lock as we approached it because a huge working barge was blocking our view, but we could see the welcoming green traffic light shining above it and Tony skilfully u-turned, facing the tide and powered us into the lock.</p>

<p class="conversationtalk">Keadby lock keeper - "That was the best lock entrance of the day!"</p>
<p class="conversationlisten">Tony - "Was it the only one?"</p>
<p class="conversationtalk">Keadby Lock keeper - "Yes."</p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>

<h4>KIVETON PARK COLLIERY PITHEAD BATHS</h4>

<h4>MINERS' WELFARE FUND</h4>

<p>These Baths have been erected by the Miners' Welfare Committee, in pursuance of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, and are the 234th installation to be completed under the act.</p>

<h4>Procedure for Using the Baths</h4>

<p>Direction signs are provided to guide you and to assist in avoiding congestion.</p>

<h4>FIRST DAY-GOING TO WORK.</h4>

<p>On the day the Baths are opened, go to work in your pit clothes, but carry your clean clothes with you in a parcel.</p>

<p>Enter the building at the clean entrance. There you will receive a key and a card bearing the number and colour of your two lockers. Go to the clean clothes locker room and find the locker bearing the same number and colour as that on the card and key. Hang your clean clothes on the four central hooks in the locker and put your hat or cap on one of the side hooks. Boots may be stored either in the lockers or on the rails under the locker seats.</p>

<p>Overcoats may be hung on the hooks provided on a rail in front of the lockers. If a wet overcoat is put inside the locker to dry, it must be spread with the outside against the back and sides of the locker.</p>

<p>Close and lock your locker, withdrawing the key carefully. Take your key with you to open your pit clothes locker on your return from the pit, and proceed direct to the pit entrance. Here you will find taps for filling your water-can, boot-cleaning and boot-greasing apparatus, and the lavatories.</p>

<p>To grease your boots, all that is required is a quick rub round with the brush. Take care to be as economical as possible with the grease, in order not to carry any of it back again into the building at the end of the shift. Boots must only be greased immediately before leaving the Baths to go down the pit, and they must not be brushed after greasing.</p>

<h4>FIRST DAY-RETURNING FROM WORK.</h4>

<p>Enter the building at the pit entrance. Clean your boots onthe boot-cleaning apparatus (revolving brushes driven by electricity) before entering the pit clothes locker room. The white marks on the ground indicate the positions of the brushes.</p>

<p>Proceed to your pit clothes locker, which bears the same number and clour as your clean clothes locker.There you will find a soap tray and a free issue of a towel and soap. Take these out, undress, and hang your clothes inthe locker. Hang your "hard hat" (safety helmet) on one of the side hooks.</p>

<p>In order to gain the full drying effect of the current of heated air which passes upowards through the lockers, each garment must be hung spearately, and distributed on the hooks, and the doors of the locker must be shut.</p>

<p>Your clothes will not dry properly if-</p>

<p>(1) they are thrown on the bottom of the locker, or if they are hung up bunched together or with the singlet or vest inside the shirt, or if sheets of paper are left on the bottom of the locker. The current of heated air will thus be prevented from passing freely through the clothes.</p>

<p>(2) the locker door is left open. The current of heted air will thus pass out throughthe open doorinstead of through the clothes.</p>

<p>Boots may be stored in the lockers. A rail is provided at the bottom and near the front of each locker. The boots should be placed toe downwards with the soles towards the front of the locker. If-preferred, the boots may be stored on the rails under the locker seats.</p>

<h4>GOING TO WASH.</h4>

<p>Take your towel, soap, soap-tray and locker key and go to the bath-house through the opening marked with your Baths number. Use a cubicle marked with a coloured brick of the same colour as the number plate on your locker.</p>

<p>Keep to these direction in order to avoid congestion and to make the best use of the accommodation for all.</p>

<p>There is a slot on the shower fitting to hold your soap-tray, and there are hooks at the cubicle entrance to hold your towel and locker key.</p>

<p>The shower sprays must not be interfered with. They are adjusted, in the first instance, to the correct spread. When they require readjusting, this will be done by the Baths Superintendent.</p>

<h4>FINISH YOUR WASH WITH COLDWATER TO AVOID RISK OF CATCHING COLD.</h4>

<p>Be careful not to leave any scraps of soap on the floors, particularly under the showers, as accidents may be caused by bathers slipping on them.</p>

<p>The attendant will supply towels and soap at prices fixed  by the Management Committee and posted up in the Baths.</p>

<h4>AFTER WASHING</h4>

<p>After washing take your towel, soap and soap-tray and go through the nearest opening to your clean clothes locker. When dressed, leave your soap, soap-trap and wet towel in your clean locker, where they will dry ready for your next shift.</p>

<p>In the lobby where you leave the building, drinking fountains are provided.</p>

<h4>AFTER THE FIRST DAY.</h4>

<p>After the first day go to work in your clean clothes, take them off in the clean locker room and hang them in your locker. Take your towel, soap and soap-tray, and go to your pit clothes locker. Put on your pit clothes there and leave your towel, soap and soap-tray in the locker ready for your return from the pit.</p>

<p>The procedure after your return from work is then the same as on the first day.</p>

<h4>LOCKERS AND KEYS.</h4>

<p>If at any time you lose your key, ask the attendant to unlock your lockers. Do not force them open. The attendant will provide you with a new key for a small charge.</p>

<h4>WATER CANS.</h4>

<p>Glass bottles for drinking water must not be used. They get broken in the changing rooms where men go about with bare feet. Metal cans may be obtained at the canteen, or from the attendant.</p>

<h4>FIRST-AID ROOM.</h4>

<p>The First-Aid Room is supplied with the means for dressing minor injuries such as small cuts and scratches. If an injury has previously been treated but the dressing has become wet or dirty, ask the attendant to give you a clean dressing. Be sure you make use of this room, which is for vour benefit, and which may save you much pain and suffering. Serious injuries will, as in the past, be dealt with at the Colliery Company's first-aid and ambulance room.</p>

<h4>CANTEEN.</h4>

<p>A canteen is provided near the clean entrance, for the sale of non-alcoholic drinks, light refreshments, cigarettes, etc.</p>

<p>Bye-laws for the use of the canteen will be posted up inside it.</p>

<h4>KEEPING THE BATHS CLEAN.</h4>

<p>In the interests of the bather is essential that the building should be kept spotlessly clean A great deal of thought has been devoted to arranging the building so as to facilitate cleaning by the attendants, but those using the Baths are urged to assist by leaving the dirt ourside the buildingas far as possible. For example, on wet days use the mats provided at the lean entrance. Again, if the boot-cleaning apparatus is used by everyone coming into the Baths from the pit, boot dirt will be confined to the entrance lobby, whence it can easily be swept away.</p>

<p>The attendants do not clean inside the lockers. Each bather must keep his own locker clean. Do not throw paper, old boots or litter about. Please help to lessen the attendants work by using the wire baskets provided.</p>

<h4>DISINFECTION AND FUMIGATION</h4>

<p>The Baths will be disinfected and fumigated regularly.</p>

<h4>SANDALS</h4>

<p>It has been suggested that bathers may desire to wear sandals in the Baths instead of walking with bare feet. Arrangements will be made to supply sandals at a small cost if the demand warrents it, but you can make wooden sandals yourself without difficulty. Shape two pieces of wood roughly to the sole of the foot,, and nail a piece of webbing or strap across the top, under which the front part of the foot can be passed.

<h4>SMOKING</h4>

<p>Smoking is absolutely prohibited inside the building, except in the canteen. This rule will be rigidly enforced and the Management Committee will deal severely with anyone who breaks it.</p>

<h4>PAY-DAY</h4>

<p>If you take your pay into the Baths, you must take it with you when you go to the showers to wash. Remember that  bathers are not allowed to go to the clean clothes locker room in their pit clothes, or to return to the pit clothes locker room after bathing.</p>

<h4>LOST PROPERTY</h4>

<p>Applcations should be made at the attendants' room for any article that has been lost in the Baths. Anything found should be handed in at the attendants' room.</p>

<p>The Management Committee do not hold themselves responsible for any property lost in the Pit-head Baths or Canteen.</p>

<h4>NOTICE BOARDS</h4>

<p>Notices affecting the users of the Baths will be posted up on the notice boars at easch entrance.</p>

<h4>SUGGESTIONS BOX</h4>

<p>The Management Committee will be glad to receive sensible suggestions and will endeavour to deal with them in a satisfactory manr, but only if they are signed. All suggestions should be placed in the box provided for the purpose.</p>

<h4>THE BATHS' ATTENDANTS</h4>

<p>One of the attendants will be in charge of the Baths and will be responsible to the Managament Committee for enforcing the bye-laws made by the committee.</p>

<p>The senior attendants on duty will have power to exclude from the building any persons refusing to comply with the bye-laws or any direction given by the attendant in persuance of the bye-laws.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>Well, here we are on the Lancaster Canal, wishing we hadn't taken our winter clothes back to the house. We had fully intended to be home before the weather turned...</p> 

<p>We are booked to go back across the Ribble Link to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal on 6th October. From there we will be making a dash for the ABNB brokers in North Kilworth Marina.</p>
