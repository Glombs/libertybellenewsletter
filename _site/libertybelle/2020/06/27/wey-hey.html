  <h2>From Hampton Court to Henley, via the River Wey</h2>
<h2>4th - 21st June 2020</h2>

<p>The end of the last newsletter left us at Hampton Court, where we remained, (with a couple of trips to the lock for water), until a nice man knocked on the boat and declared that the mooring charges would resume the following day. We reassured him that we had been expecting it to happen...</p>

<p>The sunken boat beyond Sunbury Lock had been lifted and our way was now clear but we hadn't yet had our long awaited fish and chips from 'The Red Herring' in Sunbury.... As far as we remembered the chip shop didn't open until Wednesday, so we had a couple of days to kill. We decided to travel further back down river to Kingston and top up our supplies from the conveniently positioned Waitrose there. That done, we spent our allocated single night there and then moved to the opposite side of the river for another night, then off back to Sunbury, where our old mooring was waiting and our fish &amp; chip supper didn't disappoint!</p>

 <p>...then towed to a local boatyard.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once we had passed through Sunbury lock (and over the sunken boat site) our first task was to get some fuel from Shepperton Marina. Phew, that was a relief.</p>

<p>Our next move wasn't quite as obvious. After the sunken boat site was the junction with the River Wey which has the Basingstoke Canal branching off it. We had always hoped to spend a reasonable amount of time exploring this area and, as it is the nearest part of the network to our home ground, we assumed we would catch up with visitors and travel to the house for a while. Work was being carried out on the section of the Wey between Guildford and Godalming and was due to re-open 'mid-June', so there was a chance that we would time that right. However, the Basingstoke Canal was closed. Tony had contacted the appropriate people and pleaded his case. As the government guidance didn't allow for overnight stays anywhere and they had no continuous cruisers on the Basingstoke Canal, there was no reason for it to be opened. Apparently they were not going to do a risk assessment of the entire canal just for us....</p>

<p>The alternative was to pass by the Wey and continue up to Lechlade, leaving the Wey and Basingstoke Canal for another time. We had a feeling that if we took this option, it might never be convenient to return.
We had been told by several people how beautiful the river was, so it would be a shame to by-pass it altogether.</p>

<p>So, having decided to travel on the river, we had to purchase the appropriate temporary license from the National Trust, the owners of the navigation. Three days would be sufficient for quick visit to Guildford and back, but a week would enable us to have a socially-distanced visit or two, and there was a chance that the section to Godalming would open in the meantime. If the Basingstoke Canal suddenly opened, we would purchase the separate pass for there, and then pay an extra day for the journey from the canal, along the river, back to the Thames.</p>

<p>Good, we finally had a plan.</p>

 <p>Our River Wey weekly pass.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our week passed by quickly. The river was indeed beautiful, meandering its way through fields lined with trees. The locks were well maintained, (as one would expect from the National Trust), and generally easy to operate. We did however, have to borrow a windlass from the lock keeper because the locking mechanism is very slightly different... It's never straight forward.
The towpaths were quiet; the local wildlife were busy feeding their young; swallows and terns were scooting about around us; Red Kites soaring above.</p>

<p>We had the scent of meadowsweet on the breeze and glimpses of purple vetch along the banks. Yellow waterlilies were everywhere but as I tried to photograph them they dived underwater,  as if camera-shy. As Liberty Belle pushed through the water, it rushed past her sides and temporarily engulfed the flowers. The presence of so much vegetation in the water was an indication of how shallow it was, and we did indeed come aground on one of the many sharp bends.</p>

<p>Excitingly, we did have some visitors whilst we were there.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty caught up with us when we were moored outside a pub that was selling takeaway food and beer. My goodness, that was good from every aspect!</p>

<p>Carol found us in Guildford, a place she knows well, and Tony was subjected to us having a long-awaited catch-up! (He assures us that he enjoyed it too.)</p>

<p>There was no sign of us being able to take Liberty Belle along the stretch to Godalming, so we decided to complete it on foot and Robin caught up with us there.</p>

<p>Our week was nearly up; we had just 2 days to head back. As we rejoined the Thames, the section of river from Guildford to Godalming was declared open! Oh, fiddlesticks. Rumour has it though, that the repair to the navigation might not hold, so we could have been caught in Godalming and stranded there indefinitely. Perhaps it was for the best that we had missed it.</p>

<p>Tony has promised that we can travel the Basingstoke Canal by kayak sometime. I am still deciding whether that's a good idea or not...</p>

<p>At the junction we passed back onto the Thames, travelling through places that we know, at a faster pace this time because nothing is open. As I write this we are back in Henley. We arrived  after a long day's travel. Tony did battle with the mooring pay machine and lost (or rather, won, as it didn't manage to take his money), but then the warden came around the following morning. It seems that the machine rarely works, so they leave people to fight with it until they give up in anger and frustration, then pay a chap to go from boat to boat taking money and writing mooring tickets out by hand. Modern technology at its finest.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We have arrived in Oxford now and are going to find a suitable mooring before heading back to the house for a few days to get some jobs done. We won't be doing much socialising, even at a distance, because we want to visit Mary.
When we get back to Liberty Belle, we plan to follow the whole length of the Oxford Canal, then venture onto the Ashby Canal, (Keith's favourite!)</p>
