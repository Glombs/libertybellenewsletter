 <p>This useful clock has helped us to keep track of the lockdown.</p>
 <p>(The 'banana clock' method from the last lockdown began to lose one day each week when we started eating cooked breakfasts on Saturdays...)</p>

<p>We had heard, on the grapevine, that Stoke-on-Trent is an area unsafe for boaters, where we are likely to be boarded by unwelcome visitors or have stones thrown at us. Last month we met a boater heading away from this area who bent my ear about her terrible Stoke-on-Trent experience.<p>

<p>Well, all I can say is that we have been here for weeks and walked along the tow path in both directions many times, visited local towns and parks and at no time has anyone made us feel uncomfortable in any way.</p>

<p>Admittedly there are some areas which could do with a tidy up and many of the old buildings have been sadly neglected. However, the canals, towpaths and local parks are noticeably clean, tidy and well kept. We have no regrets concerning our decision to moor here. We have wildlife to watch, walks to choose from, access to supermarkets and we are only a short boat trip away from water taps.<p>

<p>We have access to one tap a mile to the north at Harecastle Tunnel and another a few miles to the south in Etruria, at the junction of the Caldon Canal. It makes a nice change to take a trip out to one or the other each week for a top-up.<p>

<p>Etruria is named after an Italian district renowned for their artistic products, which Wedgwood presumably hoped would rub off a little.<p>

<p>Caldon Canal is named after the local village of Cauldon, but was misspelled on the official documentation authorising the building of the canal...<p>

<p>Westport Lake<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> is much loved by the locals and there are always people here appreciating it, whatever the weather. Very young children, dressed in waterproofs from head to toe, are brought here by their parents or grandparents to charge about on balance bikes, feed the geese, run around in the maze and splash in puddles whilst the adults chat or nurse a takeaway coffee. It's a joy to watch.<p>

<p>We enjoy looking out for and logging the birds we see around the lake and the canal, getting to know their character traits. Our biggest delight is our resident kingfisher. We see her most days, sometimes more than once.<p>

<p>We had heard of Stoke-on-Trent before we arrived and had, in fact, passed through here on Liberty Belle once before, but we knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>Although it has city status, it is, in fact, a collection of six towns. One of the towns is called Stoke-upon-Trent, (note the difference there), which contains the minster and the main railway station, but the 'City Centre' is in the town of Hanley. The other towns are Tunstall, (where we are moored), Burslem, Fenton and Longton.</p>

<p>Whilst we have been here, we have made it our business to explore each one of the towns in turn. They must all have been something to behold in times past, each trying to out compete the other with elaborate town halls, public parks, and other fabulous buildings. Sadly, along with the industrial buildings, most of them are in very poor repair, crumbling away. Such a shame.</p>

The Adams family
<a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a>

<p>were landowners in Tunstall from the 13th century and established as potters by 1447. Several of the Adams cousins were called William and owned pottery firms which must have been quite confusing.</p>

<p>Initially they were among the principal rivals to Josiah Wedgwood but the last family business was sold to the Wedgwood group in 1966.</p>

<p>Commemorated on the clock tower in Tunstall are:-</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>After lockdown we were released into tier 3. The Canal &amp; River Trust requested that boats resume cruising but without moving in or out of tier 3. That was a bit of a surprise. We cannot travel northwards, through Harecastle Tunnel, because beyond the tunnel is tier 2. We cannot travel southwards towards Birmingham (tier 3) because some maintenance work is being carried out in Stone. This leaves us with the Caldon Canal, which we are pleased to re-visit because we still have plenty to do there.</p>

<p>Assuming the rules don't change again at the last minute, we will be returning to Westport Lake and leaving Liberty Belle there whilst we travel in a hire car to Mary's for Christmas.</p>

<p>We hope you all manage to have a Merry, if different, Christmas.</p>

<p>In the immortal words of the showbiz legend and raconteur, Count Arthur Strong,</p>

<p class="quote">"Condiments of the Seasoning"</p>

<p>to you all. xx</p>
