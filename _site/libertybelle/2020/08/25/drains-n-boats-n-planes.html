<p>Stanground Lock is the entrance to the Middle Levels, a section of drains between the River Nene and the River Great Ouse.</p>

<p>Although people have been trying to keep the sea out of this area since the 1400's, Dutch engineers were employed to design and build drains in the 1640's to enable the surrounding land to be used for agriculture and for navigation by 49 foot long commercial boats called Fen Lighters, which would take cargoes across the Fens to and from bigger sea-going vessels. The Middle Level Commissioners, established in 1754, maintain the drains and many have now been altered to allow the passage of longer narrow boats.</p>

 <p>Yes, it works!</p>

<p>Due to the inevitably flat terrain, we had the same view for miles;</p>

<ul>
    <li>wind turbines, being put to very good use in all the wind;</li>
    <li>a huddle of trees dominated by poplars, with a house nestled behind them;</li>
    <li>a pumping station in a low brick building with nest boxes attached;</li>
    <li>a very low bridge (maybe the locals wouldn't know how to deal with the gradient of the humpback version).</li>
</ul>

<p>As we passed each feature, another, almost identical, would appear on the horizon.</p>

<p>The only flowers we saw were waterlilies, bindweed and the occasional clump of poppies. Sometimes we would see a swan, a black headed gull or a fistful of swifts, or maybe even a cormorant or a cloud of starlings.</p>

<p>The only human witnesses to our passage had to be looking through a first floor window, walking across a bridge or watching from a cherry picker.</p>

<p>It was all strangely mesmerising and peaceful until suddenly the RAF would roar into action overhead.</p>

<p>The official advice was to contact the keeper at Marmont Priory Lock to book passage through to Well Creek. This Tony did and was given a slot at 12:45 which meant we had a bit too much time really, but it was just as well as we travelled most of the way behind a hire boat which was moving so slowly that it felt rather like a slow bicycle race.</p>

<p>However, we arrived in plenty of time and moored up at the very short and inadequate pontoon. The boat ahead of us was already rising in the lock. Some time passed and another hire boat arrived. As there was no room for them to moor we took their ropes and put them alongside us. Meanwhile there was plenty of frantic activity and raised voices from the lock ahead. One woman shouted down to us that she was about to open the sluices on the lock gates so we had all better move well back. This put the other hire boat crew into confusion but I suggested that we would be fine where we were. The sluices opened very slowly and the water began to seep out... The water continued to seep out for rather longer than we would have expected, so Tony went up to investigate. He found that the paddles in the top gate had not been closed properly, so the water was passing straight through. He rectified this and the lock finally finished emptying.</p>

<p>Because the second boat was tied to us, we let them use the lock before us.
Tony went along to help them through and I made us a quick lunch before joining them.
By now our allotted time had been and gone.</p>

<p>To check on progress, I approached the lock as an elderly woman was struggling up the steps. She introduced herself as the lock keeper and said she was going to fetch her grand-daughter before helping us, on Liberty Belle, through the lock as arranged.
What? We had helped two hire boats through, who had no idea what they were doing and she had held back until it was our turn! I was flabbergasted.</p>

<p>Off she went in her car and Tony and I helped the hire boat though and started emptying the lock whilst we had some lunch then took ourselves through. Just as we were about to leave the lock, the lock keeper and her granddaughter turned up and said they would wind down the last paddle for us. She was eager to chat and I knew Tony was waiting to pick me up. I gathered from what she told me as I backed up the path, that the hire boats were supposed to have been behind us, so she was planning to let them through after she had assisted us. No-one else seemed to be aware of that. I think her system needs a little tweaking...</p>

<p>Our next booking was through the Salters Lode Lock to cross the tidal section of the River Great Ouse and exit through Denver Lock. It was a short distance but we only had a very brief window of opportunity to get from one to the other and the whole process has to be carefully coordinated by the lock keepers.</p>

<p>There are two possible problems, getting swept out to sea at Kings Lynn or coming aground (then later either sinking or being swept out to sea at Kings Lynn).</p>

<p>So, we were ready and waiting at our allotted time to follow instructions to the letter... It was a slow process but the lock keeper was cheerful and entertaining. Whilst we were waiting for the all clear from Denver Lock he explained that we should expect a narrow boat coming towards us and a floating pontoon in the mouth of the Denver lock that we should try to avoid.</p>

<p>As we exited the lock we were facing down river so had to turn very sharply towards the lock, upstream of us. We waved to the other boat and nipped around the pontoon.</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<p>However, we had taken note of the very difficult angle we would have to negotiate to get back into the Salters Lode Lock on our return journey. That may not be quite so straight forward...</p>

<p>Beyond the Middle Levels we had the River Great Ouse and its tributaries, Wissey, Little Ouse and Lark to explore, but first we took the opportunity to visit Downham Market, which was just a lock and a few miles away along the River Great Ouse Relief Channel. We didn't realise how slow the lock was going to be or indeed how slow the people using it ahead of us were... It was painful to watch but we remained upbeat and luckily found a mooring just where we had hoped to be.</p>

<p>The rivers are beautiful and were shown to their best advantage in the sunshine. The water was usually so clear that we were able to watch the fish darting about amongst the weed.</p>

<p>We saw more variety in the flowers along the banks, there were dragonflies in great numbers along with butterflies and an abundance of thistledown!</p>

<p>There were heron and Great Crested Grebes stationed at regular intervals, cormorants and terns were plentiful, as were the acrobatic swallow and house martin display teams. Swans and ducks were out in force, especially around the towns and villages where bread was in plentiful supply. There were geese everywhere, some of which began to take to the skies in typical V-shaped formation. Also spotted were Common Sandpipers, a group of which flew in front of the boat for quite some time one afternoon and gave me an opportunity to see them close up. We were spoilt by so many kingfisher sightings, each one a delight.</p>

<p>We hoped to moor at the end of each tributary and explore locally. At the end of the River Wissey was Stoke Ferry, then Brandon at the end of the Little Ouse. We didn't quite get into Brandon to moor because the last lock was far too short! It must be one of those left at their original length. We discovered this when I realised I wouldn't be able to close the gates. Tony had to do the reverse of shame, turn and moor near the lock, trying to avoid all the youngsters jumping into the river and swimming around near the lock and pontoon.</p>

<p>We walked the short distance into Brandon for a look around, then returned along the Little Ouse.</p>

<p>On one particular day on the River Lark, we had already seen several kingfishers flashing from tree to tree along the length of the river, as they do, when we ran out of trees along the bank. Suddenly, there was a kingfisher, hovering several feet above the water in front of the boat. It stayed there for a considerable amount of time, suspended in the sunlight, before it dived and then flew off.</p>

<p>It was absolutely magical, like a flashing blue lantern leading the way. Presumably, having no overhanging branches in its territory from which to perch and watch for prey, it had learnt to hover above the river. Now that's something we will never forget.</p>

<p>Back on the main river, which, after some of the narrow sections we had done recently, looked enormously wide. Our biggest hazard were the scullers, (one of them nursing a drowning sheep), although they were generally very cautious and some even had mirrors to check behind them. How sensible.</p>

<p>We arrived in Ely, which is beautiful, so we decided to stay for a visit.</p>

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">[1]</sup>
Whittlesey’s Straw Bear Festival is an ancient custom involving dressing a chosen plough boy in straw and parading him around the town dancing for food and ale with his accompanying musicians and dancers. (It’s a pub crawl!) The statue in the photo is the second one made, as the first was stolen before being erected. What is the matter with people?

March’s George V Coronation Memorial Fountain was originally the setting for a drinking fountain and horse trough but these have since been removed leaving this elaborate canopy.
