<p>Leaving Gloucester Docks, we went back through the lock and onto the Partings, which held no fear for us now! We turned off the RIver Severn onto the River Avon at Tewkesbury. A large sign advised us to sound our horn as we approached the lock, which Tony did as he manoeuvred Liberty Belle towards the awkwardly angled lock landing. Suddenly the lock opened and we were ushered in by the lock keeper. The horn was to alert him to our presence rather than other boaters.</p>

<p>A lovely welcome; he checked our licence and gave us advice on the locks and mooring, explaining that we should look out for blue markers on the flood safe moorings. We moored immediately beyond the lock and walked into Tewkesbury. What a lovely town. We decided we would visit the Abbey the next morning.</p>

<p>During the early evening, Tony decided to try and get the heating to come on using the timer. We have never attempted this before but, as the temperature had become rather autumnal and we had a visitor on board, we thought it might be nice to wake up to a bit of warmth. However, despite watching videos on YouTube he couldn't quite get it to work, so he 'zero'ed' the timer, which meant it came on at midnight! Toasty!</p>

<p>Tewkesbury Abbey was lovely but some of it was out of bounds and there wasn't enough information available about what we did see.</p>

<p>After the Abbey, we had hoped to have an afternoon tea, (birthday treat for yours truly), at the local cafe but we had been too quick and it was too early, so we bought birthday buns instead, took them back to the boat and enjoyed them on the move in the sunshine. (We also bought Tewkesbury sausages which turned out to be rivals for Braunston Bangers....!)</p>

<p>The River Avon is beautiful with views of an ever-present hill which we wound around for ages! Kingfishers escorted us past splendid houses with well kept lawns and private landing stages.</p>

<p>The autumn is definitely here with colourful trees brightening up the banks of the river and the distant woodlands.  The hedges are full of crab apples and berries, with blackthorn bushes so full of sloes that they create a purple haze in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The River Avon navigation fell into disrepair after it was no longer commercially viable, as did most of the network, and was eventually restored using mostly private money and volunteers. Many of the locks were re-built by local borstal and Gloucester Prison inmates. Each lock is named twice, one name reflecting its locality and the other the main donor of the funds to rebuild it.</p>

<p>On joining the River Avon, we had been instructed to tie Liberty Belle front and back before working the locks, (because they are double width and can be quite violent), which was time consuming.</p>

<p>Although all of them are smart and well kept, many of the locks are a bit odd, with weirs formed by piles of rocks creating wild-looking and rather lovely rapids;  landing stages that are at an odd angle or too short or both, and a couple that are an odd shape. One has a swing bridge across the top which needs to be moved out of the way before using the lock and then replaced afterwards.</p>

<p>Another has a ground paddle located way off to one side, behind a large sign, and I forgot to put it down as we left. There was a boat right behind us and, as it passed our mooring, Tony managed to call out to them and apologise for my mistake.</p>

<p>We explored the Georgian town of Pershore, (of plum festival fame), determined to get some local plum jam. There was an Abbey here too. We keep coming across Abbeys on this trip that claim to have been one of the wealthiest of its time....I can't help wondering where all the less wealthy ones were that these were compared to.</p>

<p>In the 13th Century the monks from Evesham Abbey had a manual cable ferry to take them across the River Avon to tend their vineyard on the opposite bank in Hampton. There is a still pedestrian ferry in the same location, operated by pulling along a cable strung across the river, which is allowed to drop to the bottom when the ferry is at either bank, to allow passage of boats.</p>

<p>Tony remembered that he would need to sound his horn to alert the ferryman but there was no sign of anyone, the ferry was moored and the cable was already lowered.</p>

<p>We attempted to moor at the first pontoon in Evesham but the flood-safe pillars, standing beyond the pontoon, were bigger than our fenders and rendered them useless, so we moved on to the main town moorings alongside the park, which were lovely.</p>

<p>We checked out the lovely Evesham and the remains of its Abbey, the outline of which is carefully picked out in paving slabs in the grounds, which is now a public park.</p>

<p>We moved on to Bidford where we also had a quick look around. We had picked up our pace because the forecast was for heavy rain over the next few days. This would inevitably raise the water level in the river and we were concerned that it would become un-navigable and we would be stranded.</p>

<p>So we had an early start in the rain leaving Bidford.</p>

<p>On rivers, as you approach a lock, the navigation divides in two, one arm going to the lock and the other towards the weir, or, in the case of the Avon, the rapids.</p>

<p>Sometimes the river divides around an island and either one route is navigable or they both are. Large arrows direct the boats to the navigable route, (some of them large enough to see in time without binoculars, which is helpful).</p>

<p>As we were travelling along in the rain, we found ourselves with a set of rapids straight in front of us, with the water flowing quite strongly. I would have panicked if I hadn't been struck dumb and rigid.</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">We must have come the wrong way!</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">Had there been a choice?</p>

<p>Finding my voice I queried this with Tony. He couldn't remember there being a choice....</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">Would there be enough space to turn in front of the rapids without hitting any rocks?</p>

<p>The water looked fairly furious.... My chest felt quite tight... Why is this happening with Mum on board? We were still moving forward...</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sharp right turn into a lock. Wow!</p>

<p>We soon found ourselves at the Stratford-on-Avon lock, leading onto the canal. By this time, despite being very glad to be alive and afloat, we were a bit fed up of the rain.</p>

<p>Not realising that the lock landing was well before the lock, where the trip boat was moored, we had passed it by and found ourselves in front of the lock with no way for me to get off and open it. Tony managed to turn Liberty Belle, despite the wind, and we went back the way we had come. Tony turned again, pulled over behind the trip boat to let me off and waited mid-stream for me to set the lock.</p>

<p>As I approached I could see it was set against us with the canal-end lock gates wide open. At the river-end of the lock the only way of crossing to the other side was to use the elaborate bridge with curled ramps at both ends. I pulled closed the canal-side gate on my side and set off across the  over-lengthy bridge.</p>

<p>By the time I got to the other gate, the first gate had swung open again. I closed the second gate, walked to the river-end and opened the gate paddle a little, to start letting the water out, assuming that would pull the gate closed. Off again, over the bridge to shut the first gate. By this time, the first gate was open again.. Hurrumph.</p>

<p>I walked back to the river-side gates and opened the other paddle fully, letting the water gush out which held the first gate whilst I went over the bridge, again, and pulled closed the second gate. At last! I fully opened the first paddle and we were finally in business. All this time Tony had seen me pottering back and forth over the bridge with no obvious results...</p>

<p>At last, Liberty Belle was through the lock and we were moored in the basin, in dry clothes, watching the rain through the windows. We decided that we would bring the hire car booking forward by a couple of days, rather than sit in Stratford in the rain.</p>

<p>The following morning we moved Liberty Belle to a 14 day mooring outside the basin and drove Mary home. The good weather was over and the temperature was dropping, so Mary had seen the best of the autumn. It would be no fun if she was sheltering from the rain and cold in a boat with steamed up windows! Besides, we had kidnapped her for 4 weeks...</p>

<p>It turned out to have been a good decision to crack on with our journey because the rivers did go into flood and no-one was allowed to travel on them for a few days. Well done Tony!</p>

<p>Sir John Betjeman wrote a poem to commemorate the opening of the Avon Navigation in Stratford by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1974.</p>

<p class="signtranscript">Inland Waterway</p>

<p class="signtranscript">He who by peaceful inland waterways steers</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Bestirs himself when a new lock appears.</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Slow swing the gate: slow sinks the water down;</p>
<p class="signtranscript">The lower Stratford seems another town.</p>
<p class="signtranscript">The meadows which the youthful Shakespeare knew</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Are left behind, and, sliding into view,</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Come reaches of the Avon, mile on mile,</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Church, farm and mill and lover-leaned-on stile,</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Till where the tower of Tewkesbury soars to heaven</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Our homely Avon joins the haughty Severn,</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Sweet is the fluting of the blackbird’s note,</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Sweet is the ripple from the narrow boat.</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Your Majesty, our friend of many years,</p>
<p class="signtranscript">Confirms a triumph now the moment nears:</p>
<p class="signtranscript">The lock you have re-opened will set free</p>

<p>Well, we have abandoned the Caldon Canal, (which is absolutely delightful, even in the rain), and are now heading for a mooring suitable for a lockdown.

<p>After some investigation we decided that the mooring outside Westport Lake, between Stoke-on-Trent and the Harecastle tunnel, would suit us just nicely. When we passed by last time we thought it would be a pleasant place to stay. There are mooring rings, boaters' facilities, (including showers), nearby shops, access to countryside walks and birdwatching possiblilites at the lake. Strangely there doesn't seem to be a water tap, but there is one a short boat ride away, outside the tunnel, and a boatyard in the opposite direction, as well as a winding hole in both directions for turning.

<p>Tony walked up there today from our overnight mooring and confirmed that there is a lot of space, so we will hopefully be moored there tomorrow afternoon, in plenty of time for the new lockdown.

<p>Good luck everyone, stay safe. xx
