  <h2>From the Black Country Museum to Westport Lake</h2>

<p>Having looked at the up-coming winter closures we decided that our plan should now be to fill in a few gaps on the Four Counties Ring section that we had missed so far, plus the Caldon Canal, followed by the Stourport Ring.</p>

<p>We had a return visit to Wolverhampton before turning north on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley junction, heading for Great Haywood via Gailey, Penkridge and Stafford; a new section to us. Along the way we saw a kingfisher, several heron, a woodpecker, a few jays, some Little Grebes and plenty of squirrels skipping along the towpath.</p>

<p>Gailey sounds like a much more interesting place that it turned out to be. We had heard it was a popular place to moor but we couldn't honestly see why....</p>

<p>In Penkridge, at the only pub open, we learnt from a local character rather more than we needed about Scottish exports. The people he had been talking to when we arrived seemed to be relieved that he had moved on to us.</p>

<p>In Stafford, we met a couple of friends who were walkers and very interesting to chat to.</p>

<p>We finally arrived in Great Haywood, where Tony had been stung by a bee last time we were here. Thankfully it was too cold for bees this time.  We spent some time exploring the outside of the National Trust's Shugborough House estate. There is a beautiful bridge giving pedestrian access to the estate across the River Trent. It was built in 1550 by the Earl of Essex to enable Queen Elizabeth I to cross the river to go hunting. Originally it had 40 arches, now only 14 remain. (Presumably part of the bridge was demolished when the canal was built.) It is a long bridge but not very wide, so it proved to be inadequate for the Shugborough Hall residents who wished to travel by carriage. Another, wider bridge was built for them which became the preferred route.</p>

<p>Next we were back on familiar 'ground', heading for Stoke-on-Trent, with an increasing amount of narrowboat traffic, passing through;</p>

<ul>

<li>Weston, (past the only remaining inland salt marsh in Britain)</li>

<li>Stone, (past a lime kiln dating back to 1790's)</li>

</ul>
<p>and on to Barlaston.</p>

<p> the way we met a couple and their teenage son aboard a hire boat. The couple hoped to buy their own boat in the near future, and travel in much the same way as we are. At the locks, we shared any information we thought might be useful and generally encouraged them to go ahead with their plans. How exciting!</p>

<p>We were a bit concerned about travelling through Stoke-on-Trent, particularly during half term, so we set off early in the morning to tackle the five locks before turning off onto the Caldon Canal, where we hoped to get through another 3 locks and a lift bridge.</p>

<p>We were just approaching the second lock of the morning when we heard a shout and saw someone in a hi-vis jacket waving us on. Tony pulled over to let me off and the lock gates magically opened. At first I thought it was a CRT volunteer but it turned out to be the very friendly, chatty, "Rob the Lock", who sped ahead of us on his bike, setting and opening each lock for us, pausing briefly to help with the gates and paddles before zooming off ahead again. He even turned up the Caldon Canal to help us there too. Rob's day job is as a boat mover but he has very little work at the moment.</p>

<p>He used to volunteer with the CRT with whom he still has a good relationship. Rather than get bored sitting at home he has a full English breakfast, fills his panniers with energy drinks and zooms about the towpath on his bike, helping where he can. He says it's good for his physical and mental health. Well, he certainly did us some good, we sped up those locks in no time.</p>

<p>The very beginning of the Caldon Canal was industrial but pleasant enough. Then we came to Hanley Park which was a delightful surprise; a restored Victorian park with formal gardens, Pavilion Cafe, elegant band stand, lake, boathouse, decorative bridge and balustrades. We continued on along the increasingly pretty, winding canal and moored, as Rob had recommended, in Milton.</p>

<p>Part way along, the Caldon Canal splits in two, with the main branch descending through some locks and heading for Froghall, and the second branch passing over the main canal on an aqueduct and heading for Leek. We went along the Leek Branch first. My goodness the views were fabulous. We decided there and then that we would stay in Leek for a few days to give us a chance to explore the area on foot.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were rumours that there would be a second lockdown. The Caldon Canal, although absolutely beautiful, doesn't have much in the way of facilities for boaters, so it isn't ideal for an enforced lengthy stay. We needed to get to a mooring with easy access to an elsan point, a tap and some shops, at the very least. Also, if possible we wanted pretty views and interesting local walks...</p>

<p>Looking at the map we decided to head for Westport Lake, near the Harecastle Tunnel, just a couple of days travel away, where there are boaters' facilities, (an elsan point, loo and shower) and taps within easy reach. We were a little sad to leave Leek so soon, but promised to return to the Caldon Canal and give it the time it deserves. We headed back the way we had come, turning right onto the Trent and Mersey Canal at Etruria.</p>

<p>Stopping off for diesel, coal and water on the way, we arrived at Westport Lake on Monday 2nd November and had the pick of the moorings. We settled on a space in a gap in the trees, where the solar panels had a chance of some sunshine and from where we could see the lake. That same evening we were all informed that the second lockdown would begin on Thursday.</p>

<p>So, here we are.</p>
