<p>After completing the River Great Ouse and her tributaries we were ready to re-cross the tidal section and return to the Middle Levels to do a bit more exploring. We were booked through the Denver Lock at 5pm, when the tide would be just right for us to scoot the short distance across to Salters Lode Lock.</p>

<p>So we left Ely and headed towards the lock.</p>

<p>We arrived at the lock in plenty of time. Another boat was moored at the landing stage, obviously going through at the same time as us, so we hung about nearby. The sky became darker and darker, the rain began and we could hear thunder in the distance.</p>

 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just after our allotted time the other boat was called into the lock and we were ushered in alongside. It was explained to us that when the tide was just right, the other boat would be told to leave; we should give them a 5 minute head start and he would signal for us to go. When we arrived at the other lock it would be fully open and both boats should just glide straight through. It would be a tight turn but we should give it a wide arc. All was calmness and smiles, despite the rain. Golly there was a lot of rain.</p>

<p>The lock gates opened and the first boat led the way. Suddenly we were ushered out too; that wasn't 5 minutes! As we entered the open river the thunderstorm suddenly raged above us. The rain came down so hard we could barely see where the river went!</p>

<p>We could however, see that the other boat had cut the corner into the other lock rather too much and was aground across the entrance. There was some shouting and the boat rocked and fidgeted, finally coming free and a second attempt to enter the lock was made but again, she was aground. She came free in reverse, shot forwards and disappeared. Was she through? Was it safe to turn into the mouth of the lock ourselves? We would just have to hope that we didn't smack into the back of her.</p>

<p>Here goes! The lock keeper appeared and encouraged us forward. We gave it our best shot, thankfully missing the wooden barrier on the left and avoiding the shallow patch on the right, we glanced off the wall (suitably lined with old car tyres) and were faced with a closed lock gate! The whole process had taken so long that the lock was no longer open. Gradually the gate was lifted and we made our way in. We were soaked but with so much adrenaline flowing we barely noticed.</p>

<p>The lock keeper was also dripping wet but that didn't stop him from being cheerful and welcoming, suggesting that we spend the night on his lock landing. We were very grateful for the suggestion and, with much relief, moored up.</p>

<p>The plan for the next day was to travel the Middle Level drains to the town of Ramsey, where we hoped to find suitable moorings and have a little look around. The day started well with good weather and some kingfishers to cheer us on our way.</p>

<p>We passed back through Marmont Priory Lock, where the lock keeper and her granddaughter spotted us and came out to make sure all was was well. (When we booked passage through in the other direction and had to help two hire boats through, she was nowhere to be seen until all the fuss was over...)</p>

<p>We turned onto Popham's Eau, new 'ground' for us and then turned again onto the functionally named Sixteen Foot Drain.</p>

<p>Once on the Middle Levels we discovered the bridges were a bit lower than we had expected or the water level was a bit higher. Whichever it was, the result was the same. We squeezed under the first bridge and the next one looked similar. However, it turned out to be rather saggy in the middle and Liberty Belle caught her solar panel brackets. The noise was horrible.</p>

 <p>Tony thought this was the lowest bridge, but he was soon to find a lower one...</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>...that caused the damage to the solar panel brackets.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once we were free of the bridge, we turned onto the Forty Foot Drain. Very slowly we attempted another low bridge but this time we had to admit defeat. Thankfully there was enough room to turn around.</p>

<p>We were very lucky indeed to find a mooring spot. It was almost miraculous. There had certainly been no others on the way. Despite there being no signs to deter us, we were sure it must be a private mooring, so I clambered up the steep bank to see if we could get permission to stay until the morning. There were two houses across the road opposite the mooring. I managed to find some people in the yard at the back of one and they said it didn't belong to anyone as far as they knew and we were as welcome as anyone to use it. Wow.</p>

<p>After some thought we decided that, although the height of the water seemed to be dropping, there was no guarantee that it wouldn't rise again. If we did continue to Ramsey, there is no knowing when we would be able to leave! We agreed to play it safe and return the way we had come.</p>

<p> So, we set off again first thing in the morning, a little disappointed that we hadn't reached Ramsey but relieved that we had made the decision not to tempt fate.</p>

<p>So back we travelled through March and Whittlesey.</p>

<p>Then on to Stanground Lock, which we had booked ahead. This time through, the lock keeper asked for our centre rope which she tied up at a bollard. She then asked Tony to run the engine in gear to keep the rope taut. We remarked how unusual this request was, as we are usually asked to switch the engine off. She said there was an undercurrent in the lock and it had always been done this way since her grandfather's time as lock keeper. How wonderful.</p>

<p>Suddenly we were back in Peterborough where we found the perfect mooring next to the car park. You may well wonder why we wanted that particular spot....</p>

<p>Well, as you ask, it was an important part of the Great Radiator Replacement Adventure, which went a bit like this...</p>

<ul>
    <li>One leaking radiator. Oh heck.</li>

    <li>(.......time lapse ......)</li>

    <li>A second leaking radiator.</li>

    <li>Much measuring and searching online for suitable radiators in stock somewhere we will be arriving at soon....</li>

    <li>The decision to purchase 3, as the third leaking radiator was only a matter of time.</li>

    <li>The worry about carrying 3 radiators from wherever the shop is to wherever we are moored...</li>

    <li>The decision to order them in Peterborough and to hire a car to transport them</li>

    <li>The draining and removal of the old radiators and discovery of a long term small leak....</li>

    <li>Tony's oft repeated refrain - "I hate plumbing"</li>

    <li>The search for a radiator tool, purchased and found to be the wrong size</li>

    <li>the attempt to alter the tool so that it would fit....</li>

    <li>the long search for a plumbing shop that sells the correct tool (the imperial version)</li>

    <li>the finding of the correct tool in B&amp;Q</li>

    <li>the inability to take the old radiators to the dump due to not being a resident of Peterborough, so taking them to a scrap metal firm instead</li>

    <li>the fitting of the new radiators</li>

    <li>the unsuccessful search in Tony's on-board plumbing supplies for the particular washer to repair the long term leak</li>

    <li>the purchase of some suitable washers online, sent to our house to be collected later</li>

    <li>the purchase of some radiator joints containing the suitable washers from some bloke on ebay, also sent to the house</li>

    <li>the decision to try really hard to get the washers now, before going home, so that the radiators will be ready for Mary's arrival in early September.</li>

    <li>the social distance queuing at the chandlers to try to buy a plumbing joint containing a suitable washer - twice. Both purchases proving to be the wrong type.</li>

    <li>giving up and moving onto the servicing of the engine, only to find suitable washers for the radiators in the box of engine bits...</li>

    <li>the re-filling of the radiators, with the incorrect mix of water and anti-freeze</li>

    <li>the draining of the radiators</li>

    <li>the re-filling with the correct mix</li>

</ul>

<p>What a palaver!</p>

<p>However, we now have 3 brand new radiators that work and don't leak....! *</p>

<p>(Not to mention the National Collection of washers for these particular plumbing joints.)</p>

<h2>Notes:-</h2>

<p>* Latest update - the radiators are mostly not leaking.</p>

<h2>Future Plans:-</h2>
<p>We are now travelling with Mary through Birmingham and the Black Country on our way to the River Severn.</p>
