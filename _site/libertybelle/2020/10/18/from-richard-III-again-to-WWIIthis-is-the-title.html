 <p>Pretty Ashby Canal.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There we were in Coventry Basin, all packed up to go, with a hire car booked to take us to fetch Mary. Tony set off on foot to collect the car from the nearest Enterprise office, as arranged.</p>

<p>He arrived to find the building closed and no-one about. Curious. He contacted Enterprise and it turned out that they had given him the location of an office that was not in operation. They sent him a taxi which took him to the correct location. Here he was given the car and he drove back to the boat. All this took rather longer than we had expected and was a stressful start to the journey, but all was well in the end.</p>

<p>We had hoped to take Mary onto the Ashby canal but it was lacking in water, so we had changed our plans and were going to circle through Birmingham, join the River Severn and then the Avon, returning to Birmingham via Stratford.</p>

<p>The evening before we set off, with Mary on board, we received an email from the CRT to say that the Ashby Canal was now replenished. Excellent. So we went back to our original plan, (or rather, attached our original plan onto the front of our new plan).</p>

<p>Off we went, back along the Coventry Canal, past Hawkesbury Junction and on to Marston Junction where we got ready to turn under the bridge and onto the Ashby. Inevitably we had a boat close behind us and we met a boat coming off the Ashby towards us under the bridge. Not just any boat but a very long one which had trouble turning. Eventually after a bit of boat ballet (?) all was sorted out and each of the three boats managed to end up where it had intended to be and facing the right way.</p>

<p>We immediately liked the Ashby; following the contours of the land gives it a winding nature and with no locks at all to keep us busy, it has a sedate air. The weather did us proud and we were able to admire it at its best.</p>

<p>We spent several days travelling on this stretch of canal, stopping off at;</p>

<p>Stoke Golding, where King Henry VII was crowned after defeating Richard III at the battle of Bosworth</p>

<p>Market Bosworth, a pretty, small town. Mary, having been before, was able to show us around.</p>

<p>Snarestone, where Mary made full use of the children's play area...</p>

<p>Shackerstone, the end of the line for us as the canal is no longer navigable beyond here.</p>

<p>We were a little disappointed at the lack of wildlife on the Ashby, specifically kingfishers and heron. We wondered whether there was a lack of fish or maybe suitable breeding areas but came to no conclusion.</p>

<p>However, on our last day we were in for a special treat. Having turned around at the top end and headed back, we were moored for the night not far from the junction. We arose the next morning and were surprised to see, on the opposite side of the canal, a water vole, collecting and enjoying his breakfast whilst we enjoyed ours.</p>

<p>What a delight it was to see him busying about in plain sight. We were thrilled. For us the Ashby Canal will forever be associated with this little chap.</p>

<p>We turned off the Ashby and back onto the Coventry Canal, this time heading North. We moored at Atherstone over night where we had a little look around and did a bit of shopping.</p>

<p>From Polesworth onwards, the canal was rather lovely, helped of course by the glorious weather.</p>

<p>The peace was broken by a woman working in her garden alongside her moored boat who yelled at Tony, who was gently chugging along at a suitable slow speed.</p>

<p>"Where's the fire???!!"</p>

<p>I'm not sure what she wanted him to do. He could have stopped the engine I suppose but steering isn't going to work then and we would still be there. The alternative would be to reverse but what would that have achieved? Boaters can be a funny lot.....
Tony didn't bother to respond. It seemed pointless.</p>

<p>Continuing along we swung southwards through Fazeley Junction onto the Birmingham and Fazeley. Last time we did this turning, many hands got involved towing and shoving Liberty Belle around the sharp corner. We braced ourselves for the repeat performance but, strangely, it all happened very smoothly.... What a difference a couple of years' experience makes!</p>

<p>Onwards, avoiding Spaghetti Junction with another sharp turn at Salford junction, (Tony has definitely got the hang of this), onto the old Birmingham and Warwick. We moored for the night outside Star City, behind a couple of other boats.</p>

<p>Later that evening a hire boat arrived in the dark. Poor devils. It's quite stressful to still be travelling along after night has fallen, hoping to find a mooring before the next lock... The narrow boat in front of us were quick to respond and moored them up alongside, tying the newcomer up to their own boat. So kind.</p>

<p>The following morning we were hoping to set off early and get started on the locks ahead. We were initially a little disappointed that the boat in front of us, having swapped places with the hire boat, set off before us. This meant of course that the locks would definitely be set against us. Oh well.</p>

<p>We hadn't factored in how kind the two couples on board had already proved to be. As they left each lock they closed it up and left a crew member to open one of the paddles to start emptying it for us. Wonderful. This made the whole process so much easier for us.</p>

<p>After 5 locks we parted ways at the junction; they joined the Grand Onion and we headed off for the Digbeth Branch with a little diversion into Typhoo Basin.</p>

<p>This brought us back to rejoin the Birmingham and Fazeley. Only 13 more locks and we would be in the city centre. Mum helped with the steep climb, pushing and pulling lock gates. I went on ahead to set the next lock where I could.</p>

<p>Half way up, I was just operating a paddle to empty a lock for us and a chap on a bike stopped and remarked that it was a shame 'he' was making me do all the hard work. I pointed down to the previous lock, indicating Mary and said,</p>

<p>"What about my Mother?" </p>

<p>"Oh my god, that's sooo much worse!"</p>

<p>Birmingham! Hurrah! Although, in these strange times, there isn't much you can safely do in the cities. We had a little wander around, marvelling at the reduction in the hoardings and watching the new trams in action. Mary and I tried to get into the library so that I could show her all its marvels, including the Shakespeare room, but it wasn't to be.</p>

<p>As we approached the door a masked face appeared through a small gap and asked us what we wanted. I explained but apparently you have to have some specific and important library sanctioned task before you can be admitted to limited areas....blah, blah, blah.... so we shrugged off the idea.</p>

<p>Having had a little look around and stocked up our larder, we left for new moorings, turning onto the Birmingham Old Main Line and travelling the few miles to the Black Country Museum.</p>

<p>We booked ourselves into the museum for the following day. Now, that was more like it! Such a lovely welcome! We had to stop and be chatted to by several staff members (in character) before we finally got to the office where we were able to show our annual tickets and purchase one for Mary. It appears that ours have been extended for an extra 6 months to April. How delightful.</p>

<p>Yet again we spent a whole day at the museum and failed to complete it all. They keep adding new attractions! This time WWII characters were there introducing food rationing and Dig for Victory.</p>

<p>The 'characters' have moved outside and many new signs have been put up to keep people at a suitable distance but we were still able to explore the buildings and, most importantly, we were able to have our fish and chips with a beer. I love this place. (It would have been a very different experience in the rain, but, yet again, we were very lucky with the weather.)</p>

<p>Whilst we were moored outside the Black Country Museum, Tony went to check out the boaters facilities and somehow found himself pulling the red emergency cord in the toilet/shower room, mistaking it for the shower pull. He couldn't see how to switch it off. We all wondered how long it would take for someone to come and see who needed rescuing.....</p>

<p>Well, we will never know, because Tony eventually went back and finally found a reset button. Suffice to say, no-one rushed to anyone's aid. Interesting.</p>

<h2>Plans:-</h2>

<p>We are just about to start the Four Counties Ring, filling in a few bits that we have missed out so far, including the Caldon Canal. At the moment navigation of the Caldon Canal is restricted due to a sandbank having been dumped in the middle of it by the river as a result of the recent heavy rain. We are hoping that something will have been done about this before we get that far. Fingers crossed...</p>

<hr />

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">[1]</sup>
Although it was planned that the canal would go through Ashby-de-la-Zouch to the River Trent, only the first 30 miles were ever completed and only 22 miles have been restored so far.
