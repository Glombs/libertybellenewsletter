<h2>Correction:-</h2>

<p>In the last newsletter there was a photo of Mary posing next to a WAAF poster. I incorrectly stated that Mary was in the WAAF but, of course she was in the WRAF.</p>

<p>A silly mistake for me to make.</p>

<p>The WAAF is the Women's Auxilliary Air Force, set up to support the RAF men, whereas the WRAF  was the Women's Royal Air Force, the women's equivalent to the RAF.</p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying, that this was during the Cold War, not WWII...</p>

<p>After leaving the museum we set off through Netherton Tunnel, past the Merry Hell shopping centre and down the pretty Delph Lock flight to Brierley Hill.</p>

<p>Mary used to attend the Grammar School in Brierley Hill. It was right next to the canal, which for her, back then, was just the source of the mist that obscured the playground. Sadly, we passed the grammar without realising it -  now a primary school - and the town itself was disappointingly 'down at heel'.</p>

<p>We continued down memory lane past Stourbridge, through Stewponey, (which wasn't as interesting to look at as it sounds), to Kinver, (where Mary grew up), and on to Kidderminster.</p>

<p>The canal around here is absolutely beautiful. Tony and I have promised ourselves that we will re-visit over the winter to have a jolly good look around.</p>

<p>Eventually we arrived in Stourport-on-Severn.</p>

<p>Mary had started a pattern of walking alongside the boat on the towpath first thing in the morning, helping with the pushing and pulling of lock gates and then sitting at the front of the boat in the sunshine to admire the views. We now had the River Severn ahead of us, which would be a different kettle of fish, so to speak.</p>

<p>The land alongside rivers is generally privately owned so there isn't necessarily a tow path; the edges of the river do not necessarily allow the boat to approach close enough for crew to get on or off because of rocks, shallow water or deep vegetation; if a path does exist it often wanders away from the river and may not return.</p>

<p>All these factors mean that walking alongside the boat for exercise is not an option so Mary was a bit more confined to the boat but we tried to make up for it by having a little walk around the places where we were moored.</p>

<p>Another difference between canals and rivers is that you cannot necessarily moor on a river just because it is lunch time. On our first day on the Severn we resigned ourselves to a sandwich on the go on the understanding that we had fish and chips when we arrived in Upton-upon-Severn. It is a very pretty little town which takes great pride in its public places and also sells great fish suppers!</p>

<p>As the River Severn travels South, before joining the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, there is a section that is tidal, called The Partings. Boaters must contact the lock keeper ahead to check that passage is safe before taking a deep breath and holding it until safely on the canal.</p>

<p>Knowing we had a lot ahead of us before we reached the safety of moorings in Gloucester, we set off, despite the rain, just like Doctor Foster before us.</p>

<p>Even though it was raining, the wildlife were still out and about of course, and I was lucky enough to see a pair of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers fly across our path and land on the trunk of a tree alongside the river. I was so chuffed!</p>

<p>At the last lock before The Partings, (Upper Lode Lock), the keeper asked us if it was our first time on this part of the river. Having said it was, he bombarded us with information and lowered a damp leaflet of instructions down to Tony by way of a bucket on a rope. If we weren't worried before, we were now.</p>

<p>He suggested we stop at some visitor moorings on a particular pontoon for an hour, to make our timings right. We should contact the next lock from there, to check that it was safe to continue, as there were reports of some debris on the tidal section, which may or may not allow us to pass an oncoming boat.</p>

<p>Despite having our eyes peeled for visitor moorings, we didn't identify them until we had gone past them...</p>

<p>Tony phoned ahead and was told that all was well, we should continue to the lock which would be open as there was a boat just leaving, which we would see on the way. There was a large branch in the water but there would be plenty of room. The second lock keepers calm, easy going attitude was reassuring and he was quite right, there was nothing to worry about and we soon found ourselves safely in Gloucester.</p>

<p>None of us had ever been to Gloucester and had no particular expectations, so we were delighted to find a fine and interesting historic town. The docks reminded me of a small Liverpool, with the buildings beautifully preserved and well presented with plenty of information boards and a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.</p>

<p>We decided to visit the Cathedral the following morning, then Mary treated us to lunch in the Cathedral Cafe. Tony found some online guided walks highlighting places of interest and including information and anecdotes, so we were kept busy in the afternoon exploring the town.</p>

<p>My goodness there have been a lot of monks here, Blackfriars, Whitefriars and Greyfriars to name a few, plus the oddly named Llanthony Secunda Priory, housing Augustinian Canons who came to Gloucester when they were being persecuted in Wales, then refused to return when told it was safe to do so.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, we didn't do it justice, so will need to return sometime in the future (probably not by boat).</p>

<p>So, off again, along the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, from Gloucester to.....Sharpness!</p>

<p>The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal runs alongside the River Severn, with the Cotswold hills on one side and the Monmouthshire hills on the other. We took a couple of days to get to Sharpness, stopping at Frampton-on-Severn on the way. The weather did us proud again and the views were stunning.</p>

<p>There are no locks on this canal but many swing bridges, some electronic and others manual, each operated by a friendly keeper waiting in a little office alongside. Every swing bridge has associated traffic lights which initially show red, then flash when the keeper has spotted you, finally turning green when you are invited to continue your journey. So civilised!</p>

<p>We turned outside the docks and moored in the visitor moorings alongside the tidal River Severn. We had a little look around near our moorings, remembering to wave to Cathy in Bristol as we did so.</p>

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">[1]</sup>The Severn Railway Bridge, which included a swing bridge across the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, was built to transport coal over the river to Sharpness. Several boats collided with the pillars supporting the bridge, due to the difficulty of steering in the tidal section of the river, but there was one particularly huge disaster in 1960 which finally resulted in the demolition.

<p>Two tankers, (one carrying oil, the other coal), heading for Sharpness Dock, missed the entrance in the thick fog and found themselves fighting the incoming tide, unable to turn back. They both crashed into the railway bridge, damaging themselves, the bridge, and a gas main. The leaking oil ignited, setting the river ablaze; the gas main exploded and the tanker carrying coal caught alight, much extending the life of the fire. Five men died in the tragedy.

<p>Reconstruction of the bridge was attempted but was abandoned due to costs and it was finally demolished in 1967.
