<p>We set off from Peterborough in some very strong winds making it difficult to steer. Travelling up the River Nene, boats enter the locks under the guillotine style gates which are left open, so getting into the locks was relatively simple. However, once Liberty Belle was out of the other end, Tony had to control her in the strong winds, pulling over to the lock landing, waiting to collect me whilst I stayed behind to empty the lock and re-lift the guillotine gate. Then he had to somehow steer her away from the lock landing in order to set off again.</p>

<p>On one occasion I wasn't strong enough to pull the gates shut behind us so I had to abandon them. On another, there was a boat moored at the lock landing leaving no room for Liberty Belle to pull over to collect me after exiting the lock, so I had to get on before we left the lock with the gates still open. By the time we got to Fotheringhay Castle we were rather tired.</p>

<p>The following morning the wind had dropped and life should have been easier, except someone left the windlass at one of the locks. We didn't realise this until we arrived at the next one, some time later.</p>

<p>Tony thought the footpath along the river might be accessible from the lock and one of us could walk back to fetch it, however, that turned out not to be so... We couldn't turn around where we were, so, using a spare windlass, we travelled through the lock to turn on the other side where there was more space, immediately re-entering the lock and travelling back the way we had come. Arriving at the previous lock, I picked up the windlass and we turned again. Thank goodness the weather was on our side.</p>

<p>So, back along the same stretch of river for the third time that morning; back past all the swimmers, kayakers and walkers that had noticed we were rather familiar. We explained ourselves several times...</p>

<p>Eventually we arrived outside the pub in Wadenhoe. Tony decided that, although black clouds had gathered, it wasn't going to rain, and off he went to the bar. I was a little behind him and by the time I was ready to join him the rain was coming down in sheets. I took our large umbrella with me but the rain seemed to bypass that and attack me from all sides and from underneath. I was soaked.</p>

<p>I sloshed my way into the bar which was surprisingly busy, so we stood waiting for the rain to subside a bit before going into the garden. We positioned two chairs together under the umbrella, wiped the seats down and settled in.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the landlord, we later went to look around the tiny but fascinating village before settling down for the night.</p>

<p>Off again. Surely today will be trouble free. Well, not entirely. At one of the locks the electrically operated guillotine gate was out of order and needed to be operated manually. In these situations a large wheel is provided with some mechanism for stopping it from unwinding on its own. In this case it was a chain which is padlocked to a ring welded onto the wheel. The padlock is opened using a key provided for such things. In this particular case we could open the padlock and close it again but could not remove our key afterwards. As the key would be needed many times again over the next few days, this was a problem.</p>

<p>We managed to wedge the windlass into the mechanism to hold the wheel temporarily and Tony contacted the River Agency who suggested we do our best. I was worried that we would break the key in the lock. Eventually I managed to remove it but this left the padlock in the locked position, not attached to the wheel. This meant the guillotine couldn't be locked in the raised position, as it should be. After much struggling and some WD40 we finally had a lifted gate, a secured wheel and a separate key.</p>

<p>These were all small complications and certainly didn't prevent us from appreciating our surroundings and the wildlife around us. We saw plenty of kingfishers darting around which are always delight. One of the several cormorants we saw was in the river ahead of Liberty Belle, wrestling with a very large fish which it finally subdued and swallowed before it noticed us bearing down on him and flew off. We also spotted some goosanders, which are a rare treat.</p>

<p>On reaching Irthlingborough we found a mooring opposite a nature reserve and were delighted to discover that it was home to several Great Egrets.</p>

<p>We stayed moored in Irthlingborough to sit out storm Francis' strong winds, which made it difficult to stand upright, let alone steer a boat. Another narrow boat was moored nearby and the two skippers discussed their plans for the next few days whilst observing the rising water levels. (11 inches and counting...)</p>

<p>Following our neighbours' example we went to the local nature reserve, 'Stanwick Lakes', for a take away coffee. We arrived just in time before they closed up due to the strong winds. Being careful not to have the cups blown out of our hands and certainly not daring to take the lids off, we sat down at picnic tables near each other and sipped our drinks through the tiny little holes in the lids.....</p>

<p>Both boats were heading to Norton, so we hatched a plan to travel together to make life easier at the locks.</p>

<p>Later, back at the boat, Tony and I were unaware that our bow rope was slipping free. Our neighbour, Jim, left the safety of his boat and came to rescue us.</p>

<p>Thus began the Liberty Belle and Barney partnership.</p>

<p>So, the following day, storm Francis having blown himself out, we set off in convoy, sharing the work all the way to Norton.
We moored overnight together at Hardwater Mill and then Becket's Park in Northampton (where we stayed for a day because the weather forecast wasn't good). We continued our partnership the following day but temporarily lost Barney just before we moored up for the night at Weedon Bec (where we snuck out for a curry, which seems to have become a tradition of ours).</p>

<p>We rejoined forces with Barney in the morning for the last leg into Norton Junction, where we moored up and went with Jim and Margaret to the nearby pub for a pint or two to say our goodbyes. It was sad to break up the 'dream team' but we now had to go our separate ways; Barney to his marina and Liberty Belle to Braunston, where she had an appointment with a man who was going to replace her domestic batteries. (We had been warned when we bought Liberty Belle that her batteries were rather tired but we had soldiered on until now.)</p>

<p>Whilst in Braunston we helped the local economy by having second breakfast at the Gongoozlers' Cafe two days in a row, buying several plumbing bits from the chandlers, (see the radiator story from the last newsletter), and filling the fridge full of Braunston Bangers. In between all the eating, Tony re-tiled the fireplace, again. (It has become an annual event).</p>

<p>Once our new domestic batteries had been fitted, we set off for Coventry, via Rugby. The weather was rather wet but not unpleasantly so and we arrived to find the ideal mooring in Coventry Basin.</p>

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">[1]</sup></p>

<p>During the Medieval era Dovecotes were owned by manor houses or monasteries. Over the centuries other more lowly people were allowed to have them.</p>

<p>The pigeons were free to leave through vents in the roof. Nothing was wasted.</p>

<p>The feathers were used to stuff bedding.</p>

<p>The droppings were used not just as fertiliser and saltpetre for gunpowder but also to treat baldness, gout and tumours.</p>

<p>Each pair of pigeons produced 2 offspring 8-10 times a year for 7 years. The chicks, or squabs, were collected when a few weeks old and roasted on spits, pickled, fried, stewed, braised, used in pies, dumplings, fritters and 'pigeon in a hole'. They were not only versatile and nutritious but also prevented plaque and other diseases (?).</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this appeals to Tony and he has threatened to build one in the garden as soon as we return to the house.</p>
