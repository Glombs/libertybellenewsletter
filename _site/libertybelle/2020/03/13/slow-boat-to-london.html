<p>We were on our way to London along the Grand Onion. Last time we were here we had scooted past the Slough Arm, so this time we turned at the well hidden junction to explore this short, surprisingly rural, branch.</p>

<p>Back on the Grand Onion we passed through the Hanwell Locks outside the old Asylum and looked for a mooring in Brentford.</p>

<p>Last time we were in Brentford, we found a mooring with its own tap, near the shower facilities, and we were hoping to do the same this time, but no luck. We ended up travelling further than we had planned but finally we saw a gap and pulled in.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent why the space was available. There seemed to be an obstacle underwater, preventing us from getting parallel with the tow path. I stayed with Liberty Belle and Tony searched for a better mooring but the only space available was for Winter Mooring Permit holders. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers!</p>

 <p>So far though, it's just a building site.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the crow flies, Kew gardens was very close to our mooring, so we decided to visit. Unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the Thames, so, being non-crow, we had to walk quite a long way to find a bridge to cross, then walk back along the river to the gardens, Oh well, it was a lovely day!</p>

<p>We have both been to Kew Gardens on several occasions but we still managed to discover new treasures.</p>

<p>That night Liberty Belle somehow managed to find herself on top of the underwater obstacle. Oddly, just as we were leaving the EU, she suddenly lurched and ended up at a frightening angle, dangling off this hidden ledge! We both woke with a start. Tony leapt into action and went outside to shove at the boat, finally succeeding in getting us floating again. (I remained in the bed, supervising things from there...)</p>

<p>The following day Tony went in search of somewhere more suitable to tie up. There was still a space at the Winter Moorings and, strictly speaking, although the permit holders have priority, other boats can moor there if a space is available. Clearly, no one was using this space...</p>

<p>We slid in, hoping that no-one with a permit would move us on.</p>

<p>We were expecting Joe and Carter to arrive the following day and we were now in a more convenient spot, nearer to the railway station. As it turned out, we also had a surprise visit from Robin and Julie on their way home from a trip to London. What a sociable day!</p>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/IMG-20200202-WA0003.jpg" alt="21" />
 <figcaption>
 <p>Oh no!</p>
 <p>Is this the end of Maggot...? *</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>

<p>Joe's plan was to work while he was staying with us, by either going into the office (near St. Pauls) or working from the boat.</p>
 
<p>On the first morning Joe went into London for the day and our only tasks were</p>

<ol>
<li>look after the puppy</li>
<li>collect water.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Well, 1) was simple, tiring, but simple.</p>

<p>As far as 2) was concerned, we decided to wait until a break in the rain before setting off for the tap just before the nearby lock.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a boat passed us, heading in that direction. We were concerned that he would pinch our space on his way back from the tap if we vacated it so we waited....</p>

<p>After quite some time Tony went off to see what had happened to the boat and found it moored at the lock. Ok, that meant we were safe to go!
Before we set off, another boat passed us. Oh, for goodness' sake!</p>

<p>We waited for him to return...</p>

<p>We did, finally, move to the lock, turn, stop at the tap and fill up with water, then return to 'our' mooring, but it took all day! We hoped Joe's day had been more productive...</p>

<p>Once we had spent a few days in Brentford we moved on, back through Hanwell, then turned onto the Paddington Arm.  In front of us were 2 very slow boats, so we gradually made our way to Greenford in a frustratingly sedate convoy. There we found a very nice 14 day mooring near a pub...</p>

 <p>... we've got ourselves a convoy!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Whilst we were moored in Greenford, Joe had another day in town and John &amp; Melissa caught up with us. We decided to make use of the dog friendly pub for our meal. Sadly it was too dog friendly, with dogs wandering about and demanding treats from the besotted barmaid. Carter found this far too distracting and therefore so did we!</p>

<p>Once Joe and Carter had headed for home, we decided to stay in Greenford for a while.
We had another day out in London, a day of sitting tight for storm Ciara and a day hunting the Gruffalo in the woods nearby.</p>

<p>Then, on a sunny morning, we headed for our 7 day pre-booked mooring in Paddington Basin. We had decided to take the stress out of our visit by reserving (and paying for) a mooring through the Canal &amp; River Trust online booking system....</p>

<p>Was it worth booking?</p>

<p>Well, that's another story...</p>

<p>* Maggot is a bit grubby, (see what I did there?), but lives on!


<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We are currently North of London exploring the Lee Navigation and the River Stort. We will need to return the way we came, back to London, where we will brave the tidal section of the Thames.</p>

<p>If we survive that and Liberty Belle is still afloat, we hope to travel down the Basingstoke Canal, followed by the River Wey.</p>
