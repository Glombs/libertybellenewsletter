<p>With Joe, Kirsty and Carter on board, we left Paddington Basin behind, ready for the next part of our adventure.</p>

<p>When our guests had joined us a few days before they had left their van in Hertford at the end of the Lee Navigation, so we spent the next few days travelling there, with the wind and rain trying hard to put us off.</p>

<p>As soon as we had set off, Tony realised there was something missing from the top of the boat. Our gang plank!
Initially we thought it had been stolen but we eventually concluded that Storm Dennis was probably the culprit. Very annoying!</p>

<p>We turned onto the Regents Canal and were hoping to have a visit from John and Melissa on the way but it rained so heavily that they got soaked and sadly had to abandon the plan.</p>

<p>For most of the week, Joe was working from the boat but on the Thursday, he went by train into the office in London. The rest of us moved Liberty Belle from railway station to railway station and let him know where to find us at the end of the day...!
We travelled some of the way with a boat called Lucky No.7, also braving the weather. The boat has a permanent mooring on the river but seems to travel about a lot. The skipper has a friendly dog, who, whenever she got the chance, tried to board our boat.
When we arrived at their home mooring, they turned off and we went through the next lock on our own. As we were waiting in the lock, Lucky No.7's dog suddenly sprang into action, left her boat while the skipper was mooring and hurtled over the bridge, joining a couple taking their dog for a walk. The two dogs were obviously very pleased to see each other. The couple turned back and, returning the dog to her owner, explained to me that the dogs were from the same litter. Apparently, when the sister dog from Lucky No.7 leaves the mooring, the brother dog spends each day staring up the canal in the direction they went. Whenever they return there is a dramatic re-union! How sweet!</p>

<p>The Lee Navigation follows the River Lee (or Lea - the jury is still out), and the mooring opportunities are few and far between. Not having a gang plank reduced our options further. As we got closer to Hertford we began to worry that there wouldn't be a space there for us....</p>

<p>Just before Hertford, we met a CRT engineer who was just moving one of their boats through a lock. He then helped us through too and reassured us that there were a couple of spaces in Hertford, one where his boat had been moored the day before and another recently vacated one, so we should be fine. Sure enough, we did find a lovely mooring alongside some allotments, a short distance from the town and the supermarket. It wasn't very close to Joe's van but was very near to a car park, and he was able to move there before unloading all his gear from Liberty Belle.</p>

<p>They left us on the Saturday morning to get to Bursledon just in time for puppy training classes.</p>

<p>We explored Hertford and decided that we really like the small town and were happy to leave Liberty Belle moored there whilst we went back to the house for a short visit. This trip home was for a sad occasion. Our dear friend, Trixie, who had been our next-door neighbour for 25 years, had sadly passed away. We went to join her family and friends at her funeral service. So sad. She will be missed by so many people.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>Recently, when Tony and I discussed our adventures we had, to my relief, decided against taking Liberty Belle onto the tidal section of the Thames, from Limehouse to Teddington. On investigation Tony had discovered that we needed a VHF radio and someone who was trained to use it, so I was relaxed in the knowledge that this wasn't going to happen.</p>

<p>Just before we went back to the house, however, Tony found a VHF training course in Southampton going cheap for last minute bookings. He booked and paid for the course which was scheduled for the day after our arrival. Of course he passed with full marks and managed to borrow a hand-held radio from Helen and Peter. (Thanks guys!) So, that is my fate sealed....</p>
