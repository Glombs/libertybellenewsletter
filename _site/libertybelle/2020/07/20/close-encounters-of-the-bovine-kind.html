</figure>

<p>We left Henley early on the morning of 22nd June in the hope of getting a few miles done before the day was out. As it happened, we were too early for the warden's rounds, so some might say, rather unkindly, that we did a moonlight flit...</p>

<p>Over the next few days we made our way along the Thames to Lechlade.</p>

<p>Our progress was slowed by:-</p>

<ul>

<li>a small boat closing a lock door in our faces and leaving us behind;</li>

<li>a lock that was out of order and couldn't be operated. (After calling the appropriate number several times we were eventually rescued by a friendly local lock keeper);</li>

<li>the narrow and winding nature of the Thames above Oxford. (It almost turns back on itself at times);</li>

<li>the shear number of people playing in the cool water. (Around every corner there was someone jumping in, paddling, rowing or just drifting along on an inflatable).</li>

</ul>

<p>However, the sun shone, the river was pretty and we were all in a holiday mood.</p>

<p>All except for the single sculler who suddenly changed course and steered directly into our bow. We were travelling as slowly as we could, having come out of a lock to find ourselves surrounded by people having fun in the water in various ways. He was extremely cross with us. I have no idea what he could have expected us to do...</p>

<p>We reached Lechlade at lunch time of the 25th June, found a mooring alongside a field and went straight to the Fish &amp; Chip shop which had been mentioned by someone earlier in the day and had played on our minds ever since.</p>

<p>When we returned to the boat it was too hot to sit inside, so we arranged our chairs outside and created some shade with an umbrella and some towels. We relaxed there briefly before we were stirred into action by strange sounds behind us, which turned out to be cows attempting to taste the towels!</p>

<p>Yet again, thanks to my Mother's NVQ Level 1 Cattle Herding Course, I knew exactly what to do and leapt into action. Drawing myself up as large as I could and using the umbrella <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> for extra dramatic effect, I told them in a firm and dominant voice that they were to move immediately.</p>

<p>Eventually, in their own time, in a rather indifferent manner, they wandered off.</p>

<p>I decided to cool off by going for a swim.</p>

<p>It seems that the herd of cows wander around the edge of the field, returning to the moorings several times a day to see if the ropes are edible or the sides of the boats taste good when licked.... According to our neighbour, they begin this routine at 5 a.m. each morning. Hmmmmm...</p>

 <p>We were able to stay immersed for much longer than in Sunbury!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following morning we travelled the short distance to the official turning point which was extremely shallow, making the manoeuvre rather more difficult than it should have been... It was not a good start to the day, but Tony managed to bring Liberty Belle around and we waved goodbye to the herd of cows before heading back along the Thames looking for a shady mooring that we had heard about. Failing to find it, we got as far as Pinkhill Lock before giving up for the day.</p>

 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By the morning the weather had taken a turn. With the sun in hiding, there were no longer people in the water around every corner, so we made better progress. When we reached Isis Lock, the entrance to the Oxford Canal, my heart did a little leap at the sight of the Canal &amp; River Trust signs. The Thames had been exciting and different but now we were back home on the canal and it felt good.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we met a couple taking their narrow boat in the opposite direction, looking forward to leaving the canal behind and getting back onto the Thames...</p>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/20200627-P1310801.jpg" alt="26" />
 <figcaption>
 <p>Yay!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From Oxford we travelled North to Thrupp, stopping on the way to collect the new hairclippers that Tony had ordered online when I declared, a few days before, that I needed my hair cutting off. The impracticality of long hair had finally tipped me over the edge. 
Once we arrived in Thrupp we squeezed into a 7 day mooring, managing to get all 57 foot 10 inches of Liberty Belle into a 50 foot space. Then Tony wielded the new hairclippers and I was liberated!</p>

<p>Robin kindly came to Thrupp to collect us and a car full of our stuff, then took us back to the house where the washing machine, sewing machine, lawn mower and woodworking tools were fully employed. Tony planted out his many, many willow plants that had been growing like mad in their washing-up bowls on the boat. He had collected them before lockdown, with a view to making a living willow structure back at the house. Fingers crossed that they survive.</p>

<p>We managed to visit Mary, (after some difficulty trying to use one of Eastleigh's car club cars), and fitted in some socially distanced visits with some of our lovely neighbours.</p>

<p>At the last minute Tony discovered a small water leak in the loft which we thought might cause us to delay our return, but he fixed it and all was well...</p>

<p>Having not received an email complaining about Liberty Belle bursting out of her mooring space, we had made good use of our 7 (8?) days before Robin returned us to the boat. Thanks Robin.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>After much thought, investigation and discussion, we decided that we ought to trim down our travelling plans for this year. We were hoping to get back to Yorkshire before the winter but have decided that would be far too ambitious. We are now planning to go to Northampton and follow the River Nene to Peterborough, then move on to Cambridge. Once we have completed the navigations in that area we will return to the Oxford Canal then the Ashby, hopefully arriving in Birmingham in early September.</p>
