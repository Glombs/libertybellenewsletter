</figure>

<p>After having had our new fire extinguishers successfully delivered, we moved through the last lock on the Northampton Arm and onto the River Nene. How exciting! It was especially exciting because we hadn't got a proper map, so were not entirely sure where we would have access to moorings or facilities, and we weren't entirely convinced that we had the right equipment to operate the locks.</p>

<p>Apparently, Nene can be pronounced to rhyme with "pen" (if you are West of Peterborough), or to rhyme with "gene" if you are East of the city. So far we have only heard it pronounced "Nen" once.</p>

 <p>The Nene in Northampton.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since he began planning this section of our journey, (back in Henley), Tony has been obsessed with measuring and re-measuring Liberty Belle, to see if we were likely to fit under the bridges on the Middle Levels, between the Nene and the Great Ouse. He had come to the conclusion that we might make it if we have a full tank of water to keep Liberty Belle low enough. Even so, he still keeps measuring...</p>

<p>We will need yet another key and a different windlass for the Middle Levels too, but we should be able to purchase them when we get there, so that concern is for another day.</p>

<p>The locks on the River Nene are different in that they have a guillotine gate at one end. (We came across one of these in Todmordon and it didn't go well. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>)</p>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320046.jpg" alt="4" />
 <figcaption>
 <p>Liberty Belle faces the guillotine!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In times of flood the guillotine gate is lowered and the upstream lock gates are padlocked open. The guillotine gates are then operated as a sluice gate, letting through as much or as little water as is required.</p>

<p>Most of these gates are operated electronically and to access the control buttons you need a particular key which also opens any padlocks on the gates. Whilst we were moored in Northampton, Tony tested one of Liberty Belle's mystery keys on the padlock attached to the gate of our first Nene Lock. It fitted! He also checked that one of our many windlasses fitted, which it did. Excellent. That saved us from having to manoeuvre Liberty Belle in and out of the Northampton Marina before we left, to buy them. (We tried accessing the marina on foot but couldn't find our way in.)</p>

 <p>...but others require more physical effort.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, fully equipped for the next leg of the journey, we were off.</p>

<p>The River Nene is absolutely beautiful and the weather showed it off at its best. We watched cormorants, heron, terns, an occasional kingfisher and even an oyster catcher. I decided that if I couldn't see a Red Kite at any point, I simply wasn't trying hard enough, there were so many.</p>

 <p>Apparently iris leaves are very tasty indeed. We later saw a goat trying to eat them too.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately our plan to stop off to explore the towns and villages on the way didn't come to much because the moorings were either non-existent, surrounded by private land with no access, or already full of boats (or boat, singular). This meant that we had long days sitting on the back of the boat with beautiful views but no breaks. So, despite the river turning out to be much longer than we thought and winding with sharp bends, we still made good time.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, after a long day of searching for an overnight mooring, we arrived in Fotheringhay where we stopped at Castle Farm, which we had hoped to avoid because we knew there would be an overnight charge. However, it wan't expensive so we decided to stay for two nights to give us a chance to explore the local area on foot. We found a circular walk, taking in the villages of Nassington, (where we had a flask of coffee and biscuits), Yarwell Mill where there was a lockside cafe that it would be rude to ignore, so we stopped for tea and cake, then the village of Elton, where we had a pint in the pub garden followed by our picnic on a bench on the green. Quite a nice day!</p>

<p>Whilst we were walking through Nassington we came across a notice board in someone's front garden. It was shaped like a stork carrying a bundle, and on it was announced the birth of twins a few days before. As we were admiring it an elderly gentleman on the other side of the road shouted over to us that the twins had brought down the average age of the villagers to 98! Hehehe!</p>

<p>Whilst in Fotheringhay, Tony booked passage through the lock in Peterborough that would take us from the River Nene onto The Middle Level Navigations. This is operated by a lock keeper and at least 24 hours notice needs to be given. We were given a slot for 10 a.m. on Monday morning, which would give us the weekend in Peterborough. We hoped we would find a suitable mooring.</p>

<p>The following day we set off for Peterborough, stopping off at the Yarwell Mill Lock for bacon butties from the lockside cafe....!</p>

<p>We finally arrived in Peterborough to find that there was enough mooring space for a fleet! We decided not to bunch in with the boats nearest the town because one of them seemed to have a loud party going on already at 3 in the afternoon, so we gave ourselves a bit of space and moored a little further along.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, when I was a schoolgirl, we had lived in Stamford, a town near Peterborough, and Mary has kept in touch with a couple who still live there. I arranged to meet up with them whilst we were in the area and they seemed keen to see Liberty Belle. It was lovely to have a good old natter about the past and this 'n' that.</p>

<p>We also took our chance to do some shopping and visit Peterborough Cathedral. It is an interesting town with lots of history but the museum was closed so we felt we were missing out. The Cathedral is a dramatic and beautiful building but we did feel that the visit was dampened by the wearing of masks, steamed up glasses, a one way system and hand sanitising stations. All this is necessary and reasonable and we are happy to go along with it but it certainly takes the glory out of things.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, after filling up with water, we braved the wet and windy weather to keep our appointment with the lock keeper, a lovely, chatty lady.  She sold us the required key and windlass, gave us a guide book and sent us on our way, on the new leg of our journey, with a smile, a little advice and a cheerful wave.</p>
