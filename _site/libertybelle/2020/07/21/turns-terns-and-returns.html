<p>After our week at the house, Robin kindly loaded us back into his car and returned us to Liberty Belle, waiting patiently for us in Thrupp. Without delay we left our mooring and soon discovered that Robin was still on board, so we gave him the job of helmsman all the way to Banbury.</p>

<p>On the way we searched for otters, crayfish and a pub serving beer. (Two out of three ain't bad...)</p>

</figure>

<p>We did a bit of gongoozling at a lock whilst out for a short walk and spotted a small ring on the right hand side of the bow of a narrow boat, which puzzled us. Robin questioned the owner who said it was for springing the boat which he suggested involved roping either the stern or the bow to a post when turning. I asked why there wasn't another ring on the other side of the bow, to which he had no answer. This of course set the boys off searching for information on 'springing' a boat and was the topic of conversation for quite some considerable time...</p>

<p>We concluded that the attachment that we had seen was unsuitable for the job the owner had told us it was for. Sometime later we saw another boat with the same attachment. This owner told us it was for tying on the anchor. Now that sounds more plausible. He also suggested that every narrow boat has a specific fixture for this purpose. Hmmm, Liberty Belle, you seem to be lacking in that department.</p>

<p>During this part of our journey, there was a small incident involving our radio aerial and a low bridge, which, despite the fact that it could have happened to any of us at any time, Tony will never let Robin forget...</p>

<p>Some time later, as Tony was driving, a small overhanging oak twig brushed along the top of the boat and got caught under one of the solar panels, bringing down the enormous branch that it was attached to! Carnage!</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>Oops again!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By the 9th July we had reached Banbury. After Robin had been shown the Banbury Budgies and we had all eaten a Fish &amp; Chip lunch, Robin caught his bus back to his car at Thrupp.</p>

<p>We stayed in Banbury for a couple more nights to wait for our annual, (due last February), service of Liberty Belle's fire safety equipment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the scaffolding for the building site alongside the canal was expanded to include our mooring space, so getting on and off the boat became increasingly difficult. When Ben arrived to service, (or rather, replace), our fire extinguishers, he had muddled us up with another boat and had brought the wrong stuff....so we are now due to meet him again in Northampton.</p>

<p>Oh well, it had given Tony time to service the engine and install his new and updated wooden fixtures on the boat, for us to have a nice walk locally and for me to do some shopping and cooking for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>So, as soon as Ben had left, we had lunch, managed to untie from bollards under the scaffolding and went on our way. My goodness it was busy! For some reason we seemed to be going in the opposite direction to most boats, so we didn't have to queue for long at the locks. We were so pleased to be travelling that we chose to spend long days on the move watching the world go by.</p>

<p>Meadowsweet was interspersed with the purple of vetch and cranesbill flowers, and the pink of willow herbs, making a beautiful border to the canal. The butterflies and dragonflies were plentiful and the weather mostly sunny and warm as we travelled along the familiar Oxford Canal.  We still spotted the occasional newly hatched brood of ducks or moorhens but alongside all this summer delight were reminders that autumn is around the corner. Some of the young waterbirds were almost indistinguishable from their adults and in the hedgerows the hard, green hips, haws, sloes and elderberries, are biding their time...</p>

<p>When we arrived in Napton we were very lucky to find a mooring outside the delightful Folly Inn. As we were ahead of schedule, there was no need to rush off the next day, so we stayed for lunch.</p>

<p>After Napton we turned onto the Grand Onion heading towards Northampton, passing through Braunston and Norton junctions. It was very busy and hard going but fun. The locks were now double width and so we all tried to share locks where we could. Often boats would moor up or other boats would set off so partnerships were made and lost, but we all did what we could to help keep the traffic flowing.</p>

<p>There was lots of chatter with the usual "Where are you heading for?", "Where do you hope to moor tonight?" and "How long are you out for?" interspersed with the new "Where were you Locked down?".</p>

<p>We finally reached Gayton Junction on the 19th and turned onto the Northampton Arm to face the series of 16 locks into Northampton. We were warned by a boater that one of the pounds between the locks was low, so we knew it was going to be slow going. We moored at the top and went to investigate. Three locks down and we could see that the pound was indeed too low to navigate. Between us Tony and I started letting water through from the top of the flight by opening both the top and bottom paddles of each lock until the water was at its normal height.</p>

<p>We then brought Liberty Belle through. Just as we were in the second lock, a Canal &amp; River Trust engineer appeared over the breast of the hill. Apparently, what we had sorted out was the very least of it! He had a completely dry pound at the other end of the flight. He asked us to sit tight for 45 minutes whilst he let more water through all the way to the other end. So, Tony tied Liberty Belle to try to keep her steady as she surfed the wave in the lock and I put the kettle on.</p>

</figure>

<p>Once we had the go-ahead we continued our journey, passing only one boat on the way. It was hard work but straightforward. After the locks we noticed we were being followed by a tern, swooping and diving behind the boat for a considerable time. Liberty Belle must have been stirring up the fish for him.</p>

 <p>...and diving.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We finally arrived at our destination, only to find that the mooring space was full! We ended up having to reverse back along the canal but Liberty Belle was very well behaved and it proved to be more simple than we had thought.</p>

<p>Tony then proceeded to collect all the dog mess from the vicinity of the boat, to make our visit more pleasant. After he had collected four very full bags and we were settling in, one of the moored boats moved off. We untied and moved forwards again into his space. Oh well, that was Tony's good deed for the week!</p>

<p>Here Liberty Belle's old Fire Extinguishers were finally exchanged for new ones and we were ready, (maybe), for our trip on the River Nene!
But that's another story...</p>

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<p><sup id="fn1">[1]</sup>The Salt Way is part of an ancient track that was used to transport salt from Droitwich to London and the South of England.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>The River Nene isn't covered by the Collins Canal and River Maps that we normally use on our travels, so Tony has spent a lot of time online trying to gather information about the river, its locks and the facilities available to boaters.</p>

<p>He joined the Friends of the River Nene some months ago in anticipation of our journey. We have discovered that one of the mystery keys we have had on board all along opens the padlocks and operating consoles along the river and that our collection of windlasses should be sufficient until we get to the mysterious Middle Levels. We have decided to deal with them when we get there...</p>

<p>We are currently heading for Peterborough. Sadly, the lock that allows access to the tidal section of the River Nene, and ultimately to The Wash, is out of order. Phew!</p>
