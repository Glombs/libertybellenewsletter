  <h2>From Brighouse to Leeds</h2>
<h2>12th - 20th August 2019</h2>

<p>Whilst travelling along, we had been given notification by the Canal &amp; River Trust that two flood locks ahead of us were closed due to the river water being dangerously high. We decided to stay in Brighouse whilst we waited for the water level to go down. We had a relaxing day, running a few errands and then having a delicious meal at Garry and Helen's cooked for us by the lovely Molly.</p>

<p>The following morning we were able to move off again, the flood locks having been re-opened.</p>

<p>Initially we continued with our 'short lock technique' but the locks were getting longer and soon we no longer needed to take special measures.</p>

<p>The weather was kind to us and we enjoyed being back in the land of the kingfisher and heron.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>...Here it is!</p>
 <p>It's a good job it is open as there appears to be nowhere to pull over...</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Throughout Yorkshire we have been surrounded by Himalayan Balsam creating a hazey pink border to the canal. Pretty though they are, they have taken over from the variety of plants which might otherwise have been there.
Similarly, In the hills around us, the native heather is often fighting against rhododendron bushes. They too can look lovely but are crowding out the natural species of plants.</p>

<p>To remind us that summer is coming to a close we had blackberries and bales of hay in the fields around us and the Black Headed Gulls have lost their signature summer plumage. Despite these signs, we still came across the occasional cygnet, duckling and young moorhen. We even saw a pair of moorhens building a nest!</p>

<p>Children of course are still on holiday and we came across groups of boys jumping into the canal from the locks. Not something we or the lock keepers were keen on.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Eventually we reached a lock opening out onto a stretch of river. The river level indicator was just touching the red zone, suggesting that the conditions were again becoming dangerous. We stopped for lunch and watched two other boats pass through the lock.
We discussed the situation...</p>

<p>The stretch of river was only a mile long, we would be travelling with the river flow, it was only just in the red....</p>

<p>We checked the Canal &amp; River Trust's website and there were no warnings about the flood lock (yet), so we took the chance and went for it..</p>

<p>We travelled along a little faster than usual due to the flow of the river, and kept a sharp eye open for trouble.
We could see the flood lock gates in the distance and they were shut.  The approach to the lock was tricky, with a weir immediately on the right and apparently no landing stage on the left until it was revealed at the last minute behind the weeds. It was obviously too short for us. Tony steered for it anyway, fighting with the weir which wanted to drag Liberty Belle towards it. He managed to force Liberty Belle's bow in the corner where the lock gate and landing stage met. I clambered off from the bow, taking the rope with me. After a struggle, Tony managed to straighten Liberty Belle up and I grabbed the middle rope, pulling her in. Tony had to walk along the gunwales from the stern to get off and tie her in place.</p>

<p>The lock gates were difficult and Tony had to give me a hand but, finally, we got off the river and into the lock. Shortly afterwards we were out on the other side, into the safety of the calm waters of the canal at Mirfield.</p>

<p>The lock was closed to traffic by the following morning. With that experience behind us and more rain forecast, we decided to get as many of the river stretches behind us as we could before the river levels rose any more. This meant missing out a short canal arm to Dewsbury, which was a shame.</p>

<p>All went well until we reached a place called Horbury where the river level indicator was well into the red, so we moored up near a pub, prepared to wait as many days as it took for the level to go down.</p>

<p>As it turned out, we were able to move off the following day, the river level now being in the green! So we set off for Wakefield, a place I must admit I had not heard of but turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We stayed for a couple of nights to give us a chance to look around.</p>

<p>Wakefield's Cathedral was particularly friendly and welcoming. We visited the cafe there for tea &amp; cake and liked it so much we went back for lunch.</p>

<p>The Wakefield museum was made especially interesting with its displays about the Victorian Eco-warrier, explorer, taxidermist and eccentric Charles Waterton.</p>

<p>After making the most of the lovely Wakefield, we set off early the next morning. In front of us was a long stretch of river that we had no intention of dawdling on in case the levels rose again.</p>

<p>The river was wide and fed into a wide stretch of canal. The locks were massive and electrically controlled, so my job was easy!</p>

<p>We arrived in Leeds and were lucky to find a 48 hour mooring in Leeds Dock within easy reach of the city centre. We got ourselves a map and some advice from the lovely lady in the tourist information office and off we went.</p>

<p>There is beautiful architecture in abundance in Leeds. I started off photographing each interesting and lovely building but I eventually gave up and just looked. The Victorian and Edwardian shopping arcades are simply amazing.</p>

<p>The museum somehow didn't quite grab us and we tip-toed around the Catholic Cathedral.</p>

<p>During our last evening in Leeds we were relaxing when we heard a strange thumping noise.</p>

<p>Was it our water pump? No.</p>

<p>Maybe it was a machine banging in posts...</p>

<p>It sounded like the dinosaur in Jurassic Park, gradually getting nearer and nearer...</p>

<p>Eventually, we saw the cause. Drummers were leading an Indian wedding party to a restaurant opposite our moorings in Leeds Dock. There must have been three or four generations there, all dressed up and in dancing mood! The excitement and joy was infectious. As they enjoyed their party, we had an early night ready for the next day's cruising.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>After Leeds we will be turning the corner and heading West along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal over the Pennines. We are looking forward to the views and exploring more of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>We hope to arrive in Liverpool during the second week of September.</p>
