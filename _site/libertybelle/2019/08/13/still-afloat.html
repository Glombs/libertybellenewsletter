  <h2>From Summit to Sowerby Bridge</h2>
<h2>21st July - 7th August 2019</h2>

 <figcaption>
 <p>A pretty mooring.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Leaving Summit we shared locks with a boat called Amy that we had first seen moored in Littleborough. Amy had been commandeered by the Canal &amp; River Trust to enable some of their engineers to carry out a visual check of the local canal and locks. They were on their way to pick them up a few locks further down the canal.</p>

<p>On our way, the water level in one of the pounds between two locks was so low that there was not enough water to float the boats. This was odd as we had recently had so much water that it was flowing over the tops of the gates. We let the two boats down and they lingered in front of the lock whilst we opened both back and front paddles to let extra water through, allowing just enough for the boats to make their way along the centre of the pound in single file to the next lock, without depriving the pound above of too much water. The boats kept to the middle of the canal and eventually made their way into the next lock. Phew.</p>

</figure>

<p>Later, (after Amy had moored to wait for the engineers), we were in a lock when an enthusiastic local woman came to tell us to look out for a large deer with impressive antlers at the top of the next hill. We left Liberty Belle sitting in the lock and took the binoculars. The stag was magnificent.</p>

<figure>

 <figcaption>

 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the next lock the ground paddle was too stiff to wind, so I opened the one on the other side but this was insufficient and the gate would not open. Some onlookers, working in a garden on the hill just above us, shouted down that the gate would not open unless I had both paddles open. I explained that the other paddle was too stiff, so they headed down the hill, two men and a boy. In order to demonstrate how impossible it was to wind the other paddle, I walked around the lock and over the bridge to the other side. Needless to say the paddle came up beautifully with no effort required at all. Typical. The more I insisted that it was stuck when I first tried it, the more sceptical they looked!</p>

<p>The two men went back to their work leaving the young boy.</p>

<p>To change the subject away from my inadequate lock winding, I asked him if he had seen the stag. Yes, of course. The field we had seen it in belonged to his family and the deer regularly visit their goats there. He also explained that they intended to breed the goats so needed to buy a Billy goat and that Hebden Bridge, where we were headed, is known for its duck race. He was a very pleasant and informative young man.</p>

<p>We moored at lunch time and managed to get the stern grounded in the process. Oh well.
It began to rain heavily (again), so we stayed at our mooring and got used to the odd angle of the boat!</p>

<p>The following day, hoping that the water levels wouldn't be low again, we set off to get through the 12 locks to Todmorden. Apart from getting myself covered in black grease which had mysteriously got caked onto the operating mechanisms, all went well until the very last lock...</p>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250992.jpg" alt="A long, tall black brick wall beside the canal." />
 <figcaption>

 <p>(It supports the railway line.)</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The lock in the centre of Todmorden is a guillotine lock. The top gate and its paddles are operated by hand, as usual, but the bottom gate is electronically operated from a press-button panel which had rather a lot of instructions.</p>

<p>We got Liberty Belle into the lock in the normal manner and closed the gates behind her. The water level here was high and it was pouring over the top gate, so Liberty Belle was as high in the lock as it was possible to be.</p>

<p>I went to read the instructions.... I read them a couple of times and realised that the paddles to release the water from the lock had to be operated manually.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony popped over to see what the delay was and Liberty Belle drifted diagonally in the lock, which wouldn't normally be a problem.</p>

<p>I started to operate the paddles, the water began to leave the lock and Liberty Belle began to lower with the water. Well, most of her did but her bow was caught on the side of the lock! She was suddenly at a very precarious angle, with the stern almost under water...</p>

<p>I let down the paddles as quickly as I could to prevent more water from leaving and dashed over to the other end of the lock to raise the paddle there to let water in, (my shirt getting caught in the mechanism and ripping up the front in the process...) and hopefully raise Liberty Belle before she was completely engulfed.</p>

<p>At the same time, Tony realised what was happening. Not wishing to go down with the ship, he scampered along the gunwales and jumped off. He tried to push her bow off the side of the lock but she remained stuck fast. He shouted to me to hurry, convinced that it was too late and all was lost.

<p>At the last second, Liberty Belle started to rise and right herself. Wow.</p>

<p>So, with Liberty Belle straightened, her bilge checked for water, the onlookers entranced and our hearts in our mouths we started the process again.</p>

<p>This time the process went ahead as it should but the gate would not open. The onlookers got involved. Everyone studied the instructions and offered advice. We decided that the water leaking into the lock over the top of the gates was keeping it topped up enough to prevent the lock gate sensors from allowing the gate to operate.</p> 

<p>Tony phoned the number displayed on the control panel for assistance and help was summoned.
In the meantime we tried again. This time it opened, at last.</p>

<p>We must have been in that lock for 40 minutes before we finally escaped! </p>

<p>As we moored up just beyond the lock, we had a return phone call telling us that help was on its way.  Tony nonchalantly assured them that we no longer needed any assistance....</p>

<p>We were under the gaze of people eating in canal-side restaurants and cafes in the middle of Todmorden. I was full of adrenaline, a bit manic, covered in black grease and only just wearing my shirt. I must have been a scary sight.</p>

<p>Tony and I went off to Todmorden's micro-pub to celebrate still being alive and still having a boat...</p>

<p>Our next stop was at Stubbings Wharf, just outside Hebden Bridge.</p>

<p>Whilst at Stubbings Wharf we were informed that the canal ahead was closed due to the demolition of an old mill that a fire had rendered unstable. Sad though it was for the majestic old building, this enabled us to legitimately outstay our mooring restriction of 24 hours...</p>

<p>Hebden Bridge is a well kept little place with historical buildings, interesting shops, buskers, a market and a wealth of cafes and restaurants. We spent a couple of days exploring the local area (and pubs...) with Garry and Helen as our guides, and then picked up our new temporary crew members, Neil and Monica.</p>

<p>After showing Neil and Monica around Hebden Bridge, our first task was to move through 3 locks to the boaters' facilities. Having achieved this, Tony then squeezed Liberty Belle into a very tight mooring space, bumper to bumper between two other boats. (One owner, just locking up his boat, loitered outside to make sure we didn't do any damage.)</p>

<p>Seemingly thrilled with their short trip, Neil &amp; Monica treated us to a delicious evening meal in a local Greek restaurant. Yummm.</p>

<p>There was much excitement ahead for Liberty Belle and her crew. We had Tuel Lock in Sowerby Bridge to pass through. It is the deepest lock on the canal network, manned by a volunteer lock keeper and passage through needs to be booked ahead.</p>

<p>After a fortifying breakfast we set off. On arrival the lock keeper said he needed no assistance so we could all stay on board for the full experience.</p>

<p>We were expecting to operate the next lock on our own but were met by several Canal &amp; River Trust engineers who were trying to establish why a section of the lock side had collapsed into a large hole. They operated the lock slowly whilst they carried out their investigation. We were thanked for our patience but we were just glad to be released safely...</p>

<p>We found a mooring around the corner in Sowerby Basin, opposite the boatyard. It wasn't perfect, being on a bend, but it was good enough and we were able to watch a little creature busying himself around the basin, in and out of the water. At first we thought it was a ferret but it turned out to be a small, wild, chocolate coloured mink. Very much a pest but still fun to watch.</p>

<p>Tony had taken the opportunity earlier in the week to order, online, some new filters for Liberty Belle's engine from a local supplier, knowing that he would soon be within walking distance to collect them. The supplier had been so surprised that a man who had a Southampton postcode was coming to Halifax to collect his order just to save £6 on postage, that he rang him up to check that he hadn't made a mistake... Off Tony went up an almost vertical hill towards Halifax to collect his purchase - it took him rather longer than he had thought.</p>

<p>As we were so close to Halifax, we decided to go there for the day. But that's another story...</p>
