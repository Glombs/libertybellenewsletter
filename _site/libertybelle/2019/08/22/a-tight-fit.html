  <h2>From Sowerby Bridge to Brighouse</h2>
<h2>7th - 13th August 2019</h2>

<p>On Leaving Sowerby Bridge we were about to join the Calder &amp; Hebble Canal which has very different locks to those we have been used to. Not only would they require the use of Tony's, (as yet un-tested), home-made hand-spike to operate the paddles but, to make things even more interesting, the locks are a bit too short for Liberty Belle.</p>

<p>Great care and vigilance would be needed to prevent her getting her bow caught on the walking platforms of the bottom gates, or her stern on the cill of the top gates....  No pressure!</p>

<p>So, with all this excitement ahead of us, Liberty Belle was glad to have Neil and Monica as extra crew.</p>

<p>Our first task was to turn Liberty Belle and manoeuvre her into the boatyard so that we could top up our water and diesel, and replaced our empty gas bottle.</p>

<p>We met a gentleman there who had cycled 3 miles from his boat to the boatyard to purchase two hand-spikes. I took the opportunity to compare Tony's hand-made one with the genuine article and it looked remarkably similar...thankfully!</p>

</figure>

<p>Before braving the first lock we turned up the Halifax Arm to Salterhebble Basin, in the hope of finding something interesting. It was quite pretty but, being next to the sewage works, was a bit stinky. Needless to say, we had the moorings to ourselves!</p>

<p>The canal arm stopped here and there was a footpath following the route of the old canal to Halifax, which we followed to the Shears Inn...</p>

</figure>

<p>Despite the temptations offered by the Shears Inn we had our lunch back at the boat. Fortified we felt ready to negotiate the tricky turn into the first lock. Once in position, Tony tied up Liberty Belle and had the honour of being the first to try his hand-spike. We were all relieved to see that it worked.... Phew!</p>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260081.jpg" alt="Tony using his Calder and Hebble Handspike in the lock mechanism." />
 <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Within the lock, Liberty Belle was deftly manoeuvred by Tony at the helm and Neil at the bow rope, under the watchful eyes of the rest of the crew wielding the windlass and hand-spike....</p>

<p>The locks are short but wide. The 'trick' is to initially position Liberty Belle in the centre of the lock, with her bow positioned in the 'v' shape where the bottom gates meet, between the two protruding platforms sticking out of the gates. (These platforms are for the person wielding the windlass to stand on whilst lifting the paddles to let out the water).</p>

<p>Meanwhile her stern is poised dangerously above the cill - a solid lump at the base of the top gates which they sit on to create a seal. (If you remember back to last year, that is what Liberty Belle was caught on when she nearly sank the first time...)</p>

<p>Once the water begins to drain from the lock, Liberty Belle is lowered and her bow is soon low enough to be pulled into the corner of the lock, underneath one of the projecting platforms, using her bow rope. At the same time, the helmsman moves the stern across to the opposite corner, thus moving in front of the white line that indicates the extremity of the cill and safety.</p>

<p>When the lock is empty, one of the bottom gates needs to be opened for Liberty Belle to be driven out. As her bow is now behind one of the gates, there is no choice but to open the other. Her bow rope needs to be passed to the opposite side of the lock so that, once the gate is open, she can be hauled from behind the other gate into the gap and freedom.</p>

<p>Our first attempt was a success! We worked as a team as we travelled through the following four locks and our technique was perfected.</p>

<p>We arrived in Elland and found a mooring outside the 'Barge &amp; Barrell'. From here we were able to catch up with Garry and Helen again who were kind enough to invite us all into their home for a delicious meal.</p>

<p>The following day it was time for us to say goodbye to Neil and Monica, who were moving on to the Lake District. They promised to catch up with us again sometime.</p>

<p>We stayed at our moorings in Elland for a few days, exploring the local hills, shops and pubs with Garry and Helen as our guides. It is so easy to fall in love with Yorkshire and we are smitten.</p>

<p>One of our walks took us up over the hills and back to Halifax where we had another look around and watched some of the Calderdale Pride celebrations in the pouring rain.</p>

<p>Another took us back above Halifax and then into Brighouse where we were able to check out the mooring possibilities and have a preview of the locks we were going to negotiate the following day, without our extra crew!</p>

<p>As a result of the locking technique we had perfected with Neil &amp; Monica, as well as our preview of the locks, we travelled to Brighouse without incident.</p>

<p>The town proved to have everything we could possibly need to replenish our supplies but most importantly it was close enough for Mary's friends Anne and Mark to visit us. It was lovely to see them and we hope they will come and find us again, although we may have put them off with our stories of nearly sinking....</p>
