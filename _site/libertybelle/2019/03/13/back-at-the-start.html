  <h2>Watford Locks to Leicester</h2>

<h2>25th February - 1st March 2019</h2>

 <p>Our route - we went for miles!</p>

</figure>

<p>Our main plan is now to get to Bath for Easter. This involves getting through Reading and onto the Kennet and Avon canal.  One of the locks in Reading is closed until the 15th March so we had time to kill and planned to spend it going to Nottingham along the Leicester Arm of the Grand Onion and then back via Birmingham.</p>

<p>As I am writing this newsletter, the plan has been forced to change - but more of that another time.</p>

<p>On our way we passed through Crick tunnel, the first bit of canal we had done when we picked up Liberty Belle and began our adventure.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>Suddenly sheep were pouring over the hill and galloping towards the canal, bleating loudly. Does their breakfast usually arrive by barge?</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We then passed the Crick Marina where Tony had first seen Liberty Belle.
We planned to cover the whole canal network in 2 years. We are now 1/4 of the way through that time, back at our starting point and we have barely covered any of it...
At least now we were covering new ground (or water...)</p>

<p>Travelling along the gently winding canal, lined with blackthorn blossom, we passed through fields of sheep with their young lambs (quite noisy), then through cow country (quite smelly), followed by ploughed fields.</p>

<p>We stopped off at Yelvertoft village on our way to have a look around. We checked out the church and found the village shop which had a miserable shopkeeper and a miserable selection of goods. Further along the road we discovered the village butchers and went in. What a contrast to the general store! Well stocked with all kinds of interesting store-cupboard items, cakes &amp; biscuits, fresh fruit &amp; veg, cheeses, oh, and meat products. The owner, despite currently teaching a sausage-making course, and the shop being officially closed, was welcoming and chatty. As well as him being entertaining, his sausages turned out to be excellent.</p>

 <p>These signs usually show all that is available in the village. We have contibuted the boat at the bottom, so not that hopeful!</p>

 <p>Well, that was not on the sign!</p>

<p>Having studied our route in detail we decided there would be enough time to divert down the Welford Arm, an offshoot of the Leicester Arm, which terminates at Welford. It was sunny and the canal was pretty. We arrived that evening at a pleasant wharf. We explored the interesting little village the next morning before returning to the main canal. Whilst we were there we learnt that, in this area, the canal used to have elm trees spaced out along the edge as milestones. This explained the cast metal signs we had seen along the canal which claimed to be 'living milestones'. They had been placed there by a volunteer group to mark the site of each of these trees.</p>

<figure>

 <figcaption>
 <p>We came from Norton Junction, skipped up the Welford Arm and now head for Foxton! In a nutshell!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We had another tunnel to negotiate on our way to Foxton, at Husband's Bosworth. I really should have bet Tony that he would hit the side, because I would have done rather well out of it! Part way through the tunnel we met a boat coming towards us. Along his side of the tunnel was a strip of wood put there to protect the tunnel from boats and boats from the side of the tunnel. On our side there was just bare tunnel wall. We didn't realise this until the other boat didn't give us enough room and we were forced against the side. There was a horrible graunching noise and Liberty Belle left some of her paint on the tunnel and the tunnel left some damp, chewed debris on her stern. The other boater shouted a cheery 'sorry' over his shoulder as we passed. Hmmmm...</p>

<p>At last we were at the famous Foxton Locks where there are two sets of 5 interconnecting locks that take the boats down a very steep hill. Arriving there in February we were extremely lucky to have a warm sunny day with excellent views across the miles of countryside in front of us. As the weather was so lovely there were lots of people around admiring the views, the locks and the boats, each one, it seemed, enjoying an ice cream. By the time we got to the bottom of the hill we felt we deserved an ice cream ourselves, so Tony managed to manoeuvre Liberty Belle into a position to drop me off outside the shop and then negotiate the sharp corner whilst eating a Magnum.</p>

<p>The sharp corner took us along another diversion to Market Harborough. This part of the journey brought us kingfishers and a very difficult swing bridge. The bloomin' thing nearly beat me, it was so heavy! Luckily another woman happened to come along and joined me in the final push to re-engage it. (It crossed my mind that I might let Tony have a turn on the way back...)</p>

<p>We liked Market Harborough, especially its free museum (in an old corset factory) and its ice cream shop, Gallone's, selling proper ice cream in a cone with lots of tempting flavours to choose from...</p>

<p>Moving on, back to the main canal at Foxton, (Tony moved the swing bridge this time), through a length of canal which formed part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Another tunnel to negotiate....phew, no incidents to report!</p>

<p>On a day of stressful double locks, we stopped for a lunch break and watched some rooks making nests in the trees opposite us. One of the rooks was seen to take twigs from one, well formed nest and add them to his meagre effort! Cheeky!</p>

<p>Robin joined us for a quick lunchtime cuppa then we went on to continue with our double locks, a total of 12 for that day. Our mooring for that night was Kilby Bridge, a scruffy little place. We didn't have the energy to explore but it wasn't very tempting anyway. We left first thing in the morning and completed another 12 locks to reach Leicester before the end of the day.</p>
