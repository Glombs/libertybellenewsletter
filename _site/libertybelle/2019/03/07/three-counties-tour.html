  <h2>Claydon to Watford Locks</h2>

<p>We chugged along for the next few days, when it wasn't too windy. Being half term, there were a few hire boats out and about so the canals were a bit busier than they have been of late. On one sharp corner we met three boats coming towards us so we stopped to allow them past. One of them was a hire boat with a family on board and they unfortunately steered too close to the edge and became grounded on the outside of the bend. The 'Dad' of the group moved to the bow with the barge pole to try and push it out of trouble. The boat did indeed get out of trouble but 'Dad' was suddenly on the boggy, eroded edge of the canal, soaked to the knees with the barge pole in hand and his glasses a few feet in front of him in mud! Oops! Luckily he saw the funny side and was able to clamber back onto the boat which cruised away around the corner... Needless to say his family found the whole thing hilarious!</p>

<p>We saw plenty of wildlife including reed buntings, Canada geese and the occasional kingfisher. We managed to startle a muntjac deer asleep at the edge of a field next to the canal. He shot across the field at great speed in what seemed an over-dramatic fashion. Later we had a similar effect on a partridge...</p>

<p>We began to see (and hear) lambs in the fields around us as we passed.</p>

<p>Of course we made time to visit a few villages on the way.</p>

<p>Claydon  is the most northerly Oxfordshire village. It has an unusual church and 'brown stone' houses which look like they are made of biscuits.</p>

<p>Then into Warwickshire and more houses made of biscuits in Priors Hardwick, Priors Marston and Marston Doles.</p>

<p>Still in Warwickshire, we arrived at Napton-on-the-Hill, which brought back memories of our sofa bed delivery! We made sure we visited their excellent village shop/cafe and, of course, The Folly Inn before moving on.</p>

<p>By Friday we had reached Braunston, which is in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>Last time we were here is was raining, so it was good to see the village in the nice weather, although we have been told that the water levels are already low, so the canals will be struggling by Easter. Uh Oh...</p>

<p>Robin joined us there on Saturday lunchtime. We stashed his bike in the front of the boat then, after eating, set off with Robin steering and Tony &amp; myself working the locks. We went through Braunston tunnel which is over a mile long. Tony was confident that Robin wouldn't be able to steer the whole length without incident, especially as it isn't straight, so he bet him a pint of beer that he wouldn't be able to get through the tunnel without bashing into the sides. Twenty minutes or so later, Liberty Belle came out unscathed, despite Tony's underhand tactics, distracting Robin and shining lights into his eyes. (Maybe it had something to do with Tony having fixed the front light so that it now points forwards...)</p>

<p>So it turned out that we had to go out that evening in Norton Junction, to present Robin with his due! We went to the pub where drinkers had stood watching us nearly sinking Liberty Belle back in August...</p>

<p>Sunday brought a flight of locks at Watford. I took the helm whilst Tony &amp; Robin worked the locks with the volunteer lock keepers. I made a hash of getting into one of the locks. The lockeeper reassured me that "we've all made a hash of getting into that lock in our time". I watched the boat behind and they didn't have any trouble at all! I suppose it is wrong to hope that someone makes mistakes and bashes their boat....</p>

<p>We moored up before the Crick tunnel and Robin cycled back to where he had left his car. What a lovely weekend.</p>
