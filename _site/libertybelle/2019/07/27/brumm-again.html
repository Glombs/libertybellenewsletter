  <h2>Leamington Spa to Birmingham</h2>
<h2>21st June - 13th July 2019</h2>

 <figcaption>
 <p>The railway track often follows the canal, side by side, so trains are a common sight for us but a steam train is a real treat!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, where were we? Oh yes, Leamington Spa...</p>

<p>Our week in Cornwall was so delightful that we extended it to almost 2 weeks..! We finally arrived back in Leamington Spa to find Liberty Belle safe and sound, (if a little dusty), exactly where we had left her. Phew!<p />

<p>Our first jobs were to get the washing done and to do some food shopping, so we went to Morrisons. Yes, Morrisons in Leamington Spa has a launderette! The washing machine sends you a text message when it has almost finished so that you can go and get your shopping done whilst you wait. How amazing is that?</p>

<figure>

 <figcaption>
 <p>Morrisons in Leamington Spa is just yards from the canal and has this amazing facility. It's surprising the things that get me excited these days...</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Garry, Helen and Jack were hot on our heels. Travelling from the campsite in Cornwall back to Yorkshire, they stopped off to spend a couple of days with us.</p>

<p>We all cruised along the Saltisford Arm to spend the day exploring sunny Warwick, finishing our very pleasant day with an evening BBQ at our delightful mooring.</p>

<p>The following day, despite the rain, we all faced the Hatton flight of 21 locks, Garry attacking them with gusto, shooting us along the canal to our mooring near Hatton railway station. From here, Garry, Helen and Jack continued their journey North, promising to catch up with us again in Yorkshire.</p>

</figure>

<p>Tony left from Hatton too, catching the train back to the house to get some weeding done. So, suddenly alone, I took the opportunity to give Liberty Belle a bit of a Spring clean (better late than never!)</p>

<p>In between cleaning jobs, I had a little look around at Hatton, hoping to find a nice loaf of bread. The village itself is very small with a pretty church, (closed). It has lots of mature Limeflower trees in the churchyard and lining the main road, which smelt lovely. However, as far as I could tell, it doesn’t have a shop of any kind.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the canal is an old farm which is now Hatton shopping village, restaurant, cafe, hairdressers, children’s adventure park, garden centre, swimming pool, escape room, woodland school....complete with a very large car park. Sadly I couldn’t find a single thing to buy, certainly not some bread.</p>

<p>Further along the canal, over the top of a tunnel, is the village of Shrewley, so I wandered along to see what was for sale there. I was encouraged by a sign directing me to the Village Deli. Ah, now we’re talking! Unfortunately, their idea of a deli and mine didn’t seem to match. What they meant was a village store selling packaged sandwiches and pies…. Hmmm.</p>

<p>I decided to do without bread.</p>

<p>Tony finally came back 5 days later, not because the weeding was finished but because we needed to get moving if we were to get through Manchester before the schools broke up for the summer! Creating mayhem for boaters is a holiday pastime along the canals in Manchester...our guide book suggests boaters start the 15 locks along the Aston Canal into Manchester before 10 am and to avoid school holidays. We had 2 weeks, which was a bit tight...</p>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250303.jpg" alt="The twin Shrewley tunnels. A large one for boats and a smaller one above and to the side for horses" />
 <figcaption>
 <p>Shrewley has two tunnels, one for boats and one for horses (or pedestrians).</p>
 <p>Originally the horse would have been unhitched and the boaters would have to 'leg it' through tunnels.</p>
 <p>This involved lying on the top of the boat and walking your legs along the inside of the tunnel. Teams of local men could be employed for this purpose.</p>

<p>It felt good to be on the move again. The weather was calm and sunny, and we spotted two kingfishers during the morning. Lovely. The canal was lined with Buddleia, willowherbs and Meadowsweet, intertwined with a pretty purple vetch.</p>

<p>We made brief stops at Kingswood Junction, (to use the facilities there) and Knowle, (where they do know what a Deli is...).</p>

<p>Soon the countryside was left behind as we got closer to Birmingham.</p>

<p>Travelling through Birmingham has previously been a pleasant experience, but worrying about Manchester had made me nervous of city locks. On top of that, the weather had taken a turn and the wind was beginning to affect the steering. On balance, I decided that I was more nervous of crashing Liberty Belle than meeting 'undesirables' at the locks so Tony took the helm.</p>

 <p>This illustrates how many bridges have been built over the canal since the original bridge 88!</p>

</figure>

<figure>
 <img src="/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250329.jpg" alt="The name on the side of a narrowboat reads 'Wideman on a Narrowboat'" />
 <figcaption>
 <p>Hahaha!! We didn't see him but took his word for it!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It all started well but eventually, whilst waiting for a lock to be ready, Liberty Belle was blown against the side of a bridge with quite a thump. She lost some paint and her chimney cover was crushed... Luckily the top of the stove flue remained undamaged. That sort of thing isn't good for the nerves.</p>

<p>A couple of locks later, I could see from a distance that there was a group of young men gathered there.</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">Oh dear, here we go.</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">Try to look calm and relaxed...</p>

<p>As I got closer I could see that they were a group of six young men, in their late teens or early twenties sitting in a tight circle, discussing something.</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">Remain calm.</p>

<p>One of the young men turned to look at me and I smiled. He smiled back and turned back to his group. So far so good.</p>

<p class="thoughtbubble">Ok...just operate the lock and try not to attract attention.</p>

<p>I overheard some of their chat. Something about buying and selling.</p>

<p>Trying to look as if I was only interested in the lock, I took a quick look into the centre of the group...</p>

<p>What a shock! They were playing Monopoly! Yes, really! In this wind! No wonder they were keeping their group tight, they didn't want the money to be blown away...</p>

<p>All my nerves were released in a loud guffaw! They weren't sure what was so funny, but smiled politely...</p>

<p>We made it through Birmingham without further incident. I just hope our experience in Manchester is just as good and that the young people are as busy with board games as those in Birmingham...</p>
