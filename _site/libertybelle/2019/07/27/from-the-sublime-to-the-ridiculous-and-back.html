  <h2>Birmingham to Summit</h2>

<p>With Birmingham behind us we headed towards Manchester.</p>

<p>We stopped off briefly to have a look around Lichfield on the way. We didn't have much time but saw enough to know that we would like to come back and have a proper look around.</p>

<p>Suddenly the canal became so busy we were travelling in convoy, meeting boats at every bridge and had to queue for the water tap and the locks.</p>

<p>When we reached Rugeley we stopped and took photos of a bridge for our friend Aub, (fishing legend), as we had promised. He has fond memories of fishing there and watching the trains pass by as a boy. Aub's is a turnover bridge, where the towpath changes from one side to the other. Some of the turnover bridges in this area are delightful 'snake' bridges, where the horse could walk over the canal without being unhitched from the boat.</p>

<p>The following day we stopped off at Great Haywood to make use of the facilities and have a little look around. We walked along to the canalside farm shop and on the way took a little diversion to peep into one of their greenhouses. Suddenly Tony  managed to scoop up a bee with his sandal. Neither Tony nor the bee enjoyed the experience, but I suspect the bee came off worst. I suggested Tony go back to the boat but he decided that, if he suffered an anaphylactic shock, he would be better off in a busy shop than alone on the boat. He limped around the shop until the pain wore off then declared he had no money with him anyway, so off we went back to Liberty Belle to continue on our way.</p>

 <p>To the Potteries!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our next mooring was at Weston where we met an ex-boater in The Woolpack who warned us not to stop along the next stretch of the canal because of all the beggars. Oh heck...</p>

<p>Later that evening, Tony was doing some planning for our journey ahead and discovered that we would need a hand spike for some of the Yorkshire locks. A special tool needed to operate the ground paddles. Oh for goodness sake!</p>

<p>The next stretch of canal turned out to be lovely, with no sign of any beggars....what was that all about?</p>

<p>With Tony at the helm we headed for the Harecastle tunnel and, after a brief safety talk, we were ushered straight in. My goodness it was stressful. It was dark, narrow, noisy (due to the air extraction), low, long and not quite straight. It took about 40 minutes to travel through and it was a relief to escape!</p>

<p>Beyond the tunnel we turned onto the Macclesfield canal which was beautiful all the way along. There was bridge after bridge as well as narrow pinches where there used to be swing bridges. For some reason people needed to cross this canal in far more places than other canals!</p>

<p>We climbed the hill to Macclesfield through some lovely locks with beautiful views, even in the pouring rain! By the time we moored at Bollington the rain had stopped and we climbed to a local view point. We were taken aback by the fabulous 360 degree views and delighted by what we saw of the village.</p>

 <p>She had several, almost fully grown, youngsters.</p>

<p>We progressed to Marple junction where we hoped to moor for the night but there was no space so we had little choice but to start down the next flight of locks. A young man sped us up by helping us through every single one, bless him. A little boy called Oscar also tried to help, so Tony gave him and his dad a ride down one lock and through to the next. There were several onlookers, all very friendly and interested.</p>

<p>We finally moored at 9pm in Ashton-under-Lyne, vowing to get up early in the morning to face the Ashton Canal. This stretch of canal into Manchester is known for the trouble caused by young lads boarding boats and intimidating boaters. We had rushed to get here before the school holidays and intended to complete all the locks whilst any lads not attending school were still in bed!</p>

<p>To further complicate matters, a swing bridge between the second and third locks was broken and could only be operated by a Canal &amp; River Trust employee who would be there for one hour  between 8 &amp; 9 am, and then 4 &amp; 5pm.</p>

<p>It was quite hard work, especially with the wind trying to blow Liberty Belle out of line with the locks, but it all went surprisingly well. The towpath was smart and well used by friendly people making their way to school and work. We arrived in Manchester without any trouble at all and found a pleasant mooring in a residential area near an aqueduct. What was all the fuss about?</p>

<p>We went to look for somewhere in town to have lunch. We seemed to be the only boat in Manchester. As we ventured further along we discovered that the canal side was populated by drunks and drug users. We didn’t have any trouble from them really as they all seemed either cheerful &amp; friendly or passed out, but I was definitely out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>Manchester itself is an interesting city, packed with wonderful architecture both old and new. We decided to take a day off boating and  spend the following day having a proper look around. We discovered the Clink cafe (a charity helping ex-offenders) which had good coffee, tasty flapjacks and a pleasant atmosphere. The menu looked interesting and affordable.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of Garry we went to The Industry &amp; Science Museum which took up most of our day. This is well worth a visit, if only for the working mill machinery converting cotton bails to calico. There are plenty of reasons to go back to the city so we have added it to our list of places to re-visit.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>These lock gates are opened and closed by winding chains. A new experience!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, promising to return, we set off through Manchester. My goodness it was hard work. The sun beat down on us, the canal was shallow, due to collapsed overflow channels letting the water out, full of rubbish and, although the  lock paddles were easy to operate, they had badly positioned steps and railings making access difficult. Some were very deep indeed and Tony had to climb up steep, slimey ladders in order to hold onto Liberty Belle’s rope to keep her reasonably still in the double width locks. It was difficult to moor because we couldn’t get to the edge without getting grounded.</p>

<p>One lock gate refused to move. I gave it everything I had, then Tony joined me and we were both defeated by it. Two passers-by joined in but it wouldn’t budge. Another boat (with a film crew making a series called Canal Boat Diaries for BBC4) came along and tried to contact the Canal &amp; River Trust who weren’t answering the phone (!?). Finally, with four of us shoving &amp; heaving at the bloomin’ thing, we got it open. It took me several days to recover physically from that episode...</p>

<p>We had to steer around poles and signs indicating underwater obstacles and a motorbike, just sticking up above the water. We mentioned this to a couple of people we met who just seemed to think we were lucky it wasn’t a car.</p>

<p>Two lads asked us for a lift and when we refused they threw sticky liquid on us from the next two bridges. We were sticking to the deck and the prop had gathered so much junk we were barely moving.</p>

<p>That was enough for me. I would have gone home that day if it had been an option. Almost in tears, covered in some unknown sticky liquid, in 30 degrees heat, already exhausted, I still had two more locks to do. </p>

<p>We finally arrived at our mooring. We cleaned everything up and showered. What a day!</p>

<p>We set off early again on another unbelievably hot day. Early on we managed to open the top paddles of the lock to fill it without noticing that one of the bottom paddles was still open. It had a different style of indicator that we hadn’t seen before and really, we were too tired. Having drained rather a lot of water from the pound, we realised our mistake. Oh heck. The day didn’t get much better as I managed to leave my windlass at a swing bridge and didn’t notice for about a mile or so and we got grounded at a lock landing point and Tony had to employ the barge pole to heave us back afloat.</p>

<p>Finally we found a mooring in Littleborough. After what we had been through it seemed like paradise! The canal was well kept and the views of the Pennines were pretty and inviting. Phew. Not only that but we are now near enough to Garry and Helen for them to visit us, which is lovely.</p>

<p>First we had to get some supplies so we walked to the local Co-op. We arrived to find it surrounded by Police tape - there had been a ram-raid which involved lots of broken glass, smashed beer bottles and scattered toilet roll. So, not quite paradise after all!</p>

<p>Our next mooring was at a little place called Summit which is where the canal stops climbing uphill and begins to go back down. We have spent a little time here exploring the countryside. Now that the temperature has gone back down to the early 20’s, I have caught up on my sleep, my body has recovered from all those locks and the views around me are so awesome I can begin to think that the journey through Manchester was worth it...</p>

<p>Lucky us!</p>

<p>We now intend to slowly make our way around Yorkshire, appreciating everything it has to offer.</p>
