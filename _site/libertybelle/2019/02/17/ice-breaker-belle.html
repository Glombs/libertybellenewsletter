<p>The snow was followed by a warmer, sunny day. We decided to walk to Kidlington again to investigate the church. The ground was still frozen so there was much less mud to contend with.</p>

<p>The following day we woke up to a frozen canal!</p>

<p>We had to move on to get water and to make our way back to Banbury for a car hire at the beginning of February. Setting off from the mooring between boats was tricky as Liberty Belle does't like to travel sideways against ice. The lift bridge needed 2 attempts to open as it was frozen in place then the tap had to be defrosted, so things were off to a slow start. Then of course Liberty Belle had to break the ice as she went along. This made steering very tricky as she preferred to follow the line of the cracks she made rather than obey Tony’s steering. It was exciting though, smashing the ice into massive sheets and watching them slide over each other as we pushed them into the sides of the canal. The ice vibrated as we smashed our way through, making the light dance on the surface. The plants at the edge of the canal shivered violently as the ice sheets crunched into them.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch just before Pigeons lock. Another boat was in front of us so it would be a while before we could go through, and it was lunchtime. Over lunch we discussed our afternoon plan and decided not to do any more cruising that day. Steering Liberty Belle through the ice was hard work. I could have taken over from Tony to give him a rest but, to be honest, he would have to be on hand in case I got into difficulty so it would be just as stressful for him if not more so! By the time we had cooked and eaten we were half way through the afternoon anyway and would be in danger of trying to moor up in the dark.
So, we went for a walk instead to have a quick look at the nearby village of Tackley. According to the guide book it had just a church and a school, but a church is always worth a look. Tackley proved to be another delightful honey-coloured Oxfordshire village with a manorial estate and large farm buildings. The church was lovely and will need further investigation when we have more time, especially as it has an excellent exhibition detailing the history of the village.</p>

<p>We were also pleasantly surprised to find a pub (no time for that!) and a village community shop which was exceptionally well stocked. Having tramped mud through the shop we felt obliged to buy something, so we purchased a large homemade fruit cake... that'll do nicely.</p>

<p>Up and off after breakfast the next morning. The canal was no longer frozen solid. I had a strained muscle in my back so Tony volunteered to do the locks and I took the helm. It made a pleasant change to swap duties. The day started as calm, grey and overcast but the conditions allowed us to see the fish swimming in the canal. There are loads of them! I suppose all those kingfishers, herons, cormorants and fishermen can’t be there for nothing! We also spotted a single roe deer with small, velvet covered antlers walking beside the canal and another seven of them in a field. Sadly, later in the day we also saw a dead muntjac deer floating in the canal. Whilst quietly contemplating these things as we chugged along, a train, passing by on the track near the canal, hooted it’s horn. The driver waved to us enthusiastically. Tony cheerfully waved back but I was too busy trying to push my heart back into my chest. During the day we came across some patches of canal which were still iced over but this didn't really prove to be a problem.</p>

<p>We did catch up with the boat that had been in front of us the day before and he said he'd been living on board a narrowboat for 6 years and he had only just realised that you aren't supposed to travel when the canal is iced over as you are in danger of scratching the paint on your own and other people's boats. Oh. That would explain the black look we had had from one woman leaning out of the hatch from her moored boat. Oops.</p>

<p>Over the next few days we did a bit of cruising when the weather was suitable, trying to get to Banbury before the canal re-froze. When the wind was too strong for cruising we filled in our time walking. Along the way we investigated:-
Somerton, another ancient and beautiful church in a pretty village with thatched stone houses;</p>

<p>Souldern, a pretty stone village with lots of footpaths, a Church and a pub;
Deddington, again.This time we set off with the whole day ahead of us so there was no danger of running out of daylight. However, we still didn't get to see the inside of the church as there was a Sunday service being held. We did delay our visit by going to the local hotel for tea and cake but managed to mis-time it.</p>

<p>Our Deddington Hotel experience was farcical...</p>

<p>The scene - a room in an old hotel with a counter, a few tables and comfortable chairs. Archways through to two similar rooms and a restaurant.</p>

<xmp>
Enter 2 muddy hikers, wrapped up against the cold wind and rain. They remove their boots at the entrance and approach the counter in front of them, obviously pleased to see the choice of teas, coffees and cakes. At one of the tables are two young couples with a toddler chatting and relaxed.

The two hikers look at the offerings on the counter and discuss them. They wander around a little and find a menu which they look at at length and discuss. They discuss the seating options, choose a table near the counter and sit down. They wait.

In bustles the Woman in Orange, straight to the young couples to explain that there has been a bit of a mix up with the staff “No-one was sure which job they were meant to be doing. Your drinks are being prepared now"
Woman in Orange indicates Waitress 1 who has appeared behind the counter at the coffee machine, preparing drinks. Waitress 1 delivers the drinks to the table.

Hiker 1, addressing the woman in orange as she bustles back towards the kitchen. "Do we need to go to the counter to be served or should we wait for table service?"

Woman in Orange - “Aren’t you being served?”

Hikers (in unison) - “No” 

Woman in Orange darts behind the counter - "What would you like to order?"

Having had plenty of time to discuss this Hiker 1 orders immediately. Indicating a chalk board on the counter detailing the contents of a cream tea - " One cream tea and a latte, please".

Woman in Orange - “I will see if we have any”  

Woman in orange disappears into the kitchen behind the counter returning promptly.

Woman in Orange - "We don't do cream teas at this time of year. You can order anything off the breakfast menu.”

The two Hikers share a confused look and glance back at the board offering cream teas.

Hiker 2, already knowing the menu off by heart - "I'll have a croissant then."

Hiker 1 - One tea, one latte and two croissants then, please"

Woman in Orange - “I will see if we have any.”

Hikers exchange a look.

Woman in Orange darts into the kitchen again and returns promptly.

Woman in Orange - “Sorry, we don’t have any croissants, we usually have some left over from breakfast, but not today.”

Hikers look at each other in disbelief and return to the counter to look at the display of cakes, choose an item each and return to their seats.

Woman in Orange plates up the cakes and delivers them to the waiting Hikers.

Woman in Orange lays out a tray on the counter with a cup &amp; saucer, a teapot with a tea bag and it’s lid open wide to receive the hot water, a saucer waiting for the latte glass and a jug of milk.

Waitresses 2 &amp; 3 arrive behind the counter; two young girls ready to start work.

The Woman in Orange indicates the tray and instructs Waitress 2 to finish the order.

Waitress 2 uses the machine to make a latte and places it on the waiting saucer.

The door opens and a Man, Woman, Boy &amp; Girl walk in and approach the counter.

Waitress 2 - "Hello, can I help you?"

Woman - "We have booked a table for lunch"

Waitress 2 -" Just a second and I will check your booking it for you"

Waitress 2 quickly fetches a laptop from beneath the counter and confirms their reservation.

Waitress 2 escorts the family into another room.

Waitresses 2 &amp; 3 confer then both start to move some furniture in the dining room.

The two Hikers look at each other in disbelief. They look at the tray in disbelief. Hiker 1 gets up and follows the waitresses. Hiker 2 follows Hiker 1.

Hiker 1 - “Excuse me! Aren’t you going to finish serving us first?”

Waitress 2 - “Are you the tea and coffee?”

Hikers 1 &amp; 2 in unison - “Yes!”

Hiker 2 - “My coffee is sitting there getting cold waiting for you to make the tea! You shouldn’t  abandon one customer to serve the next.”

Waitress 2 calmly returns to the counter, pours hot water into the waiting teapot and delivers the tray to the Hikers. No sign of apology or embarrassment whatsoever.

Hikers look at each other in disbelief.
