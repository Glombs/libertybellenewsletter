 <figcaption>
 <p>Welcome</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, there we were on the Thames hoping to travel into London.</p>

<p>Going straight down the river is an option for narrowboats and, in fact, Liberty Belle has done that in a previous life, with different crew. However, this involves dealing with the tidal section of the river as well as HUGE boats and even some waves, so I chickened out of that...</p>

<p>The other option is to approach London by riding on the back of the Grand Onion, which joins the Thames at Brentford. I thought this would be a much easier option but it still involves a bit of tidal river between Teddington Lock and The Thames Lock in Brentford, so some planning ahead is required.</p>

<p>Boaters are required to give 48 hours notice to book passage through the lock at Brentford if the tide isn’t going to be at the correct position during normal lock operating times. One of the options for booking this was by email which seemed sensible as we could put all the relevant information down in writing, to avoid any confusion.</p>

<p>So, on the Monday, an email was sent requesting passage through the Thames Lock at Brentford on the following Thursday at 19:30.</p>

<p>By Wednesday morning we were concerned that no confirmation email had arrived. Tony made a phone call. He was told he was talking to the London office but needed to speak to the Brentford office, so they attempted to put him through. This didn't work so they promised Tony a call back.</p>

<p>Tony phoned the lock keeper himself, in the hope that he would be of help, but he just repeated the correct procedure for booking. Fair enough.</p>

<p>No phone call came.</p>

<p>The best option seemed to be to alter our plans.</p>

<p>Right then, plan B.</p>

<p>Get up at 5:00 on Thursday morning, get through Teddington Lock (manned) and get to Brentford Lock for 8:00 when there was a 30 minute window where the lock was going to be manned and the tide was right.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday afternoon Tony received a phone call (at last) from a woman who explained that we should give 48 hours notice.....</p>

<p>Tony explained that we had done that, by email, but we had since altered our plans anyway. He tried to discuss the timings for passing through the locks according to the tide, but the woman on the phone didn't know anything about that....</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>So, on the Thursday morning we got up at 5:00 and arrived at Teddington lock at 6:15. All went smoothly. The Lock Keeper, feeling chatty, asked us our plans for the day.</p>

<p>“We’re going to go through the Tidal Lock at Brentford”</p>

<p>(Looking concerned) “That won’t be operated until 8 o’clock”</p>

<p>“We know. How long does it take to get there then?”</p>

<p>“An hour and 20 minutes.”</p>

<p>(Looking confused)“So that should be just right then….”</p>

<p>“You’ll be alright if the tide holds up otherwise you’ll be in the mud”</p>

<p>This conversation wasn’t very reassuring really.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>I think it is Liberty Belle that is a bit tippy, not the lock...</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Boldly onwards!</p>

<p>Luckily Tony had taken the time and trouble to look on the internet at pictures of the turning from the Thames towards the Brentford Lock, otherwise we would have gone straight past it. There was a distinctive metal sculpture there, which Tony recognised just in time.</p>

<p>So, turning the corner, we arrived at the Thames Lock, Brentford, at 7:45. Perfect. There was surprisingly little room for boats to wait there. Already a small boat was tied up to a bollard in the lock mouth. There was another bollard, several feet above our heads, to the right of the lock. It would mean some reversing and faffing when the lock opened but there was no choice. Tony managed to tie Liberty Belle (precariously) to that.</p>

<p>So, with only one rope tied and the water slowly dropping, we waited.</p>

<p>8:00 came and no lock keeper arrived.</p>

<p>Liberty Belle was being slowly lowered towards the muddy bottom.</p>

<p>8:15. Still no lock keeper. Tony tried to phone the lock keeper with no luck.</p>

<p>Eventually, at 8:17, almost at the end of our 30 minute window, the lock keeper arrived and let us into the lock. Wow. Talk about stressful...</p>

<p>We passed through onto the canal. I was so relieved I wanted to cry!</p>

<p>We immediately found a mooring, 14 days for free with our own tap. Joy! (We only wanted one night but it was nice to have the option!)</p>

<p>It was still early, so we walked to Kew Gardens to spend the rest of the day. On the way, Tony had a phone call in response to our request to book passage through the Brentford Lock.....</p>

<p>We were delighted to find a 7 day mooring directly outside the station! Amazing!</p>

<p>The four of us went for an evening meal together. We had fish and chips so posh that we had a bottle of wine with it! Tony and I didn’t even know that was an option!</p>

<p>* 'The Julia Tour of London'.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Julia who guided us by text message around an area of London which she knows well. We wouldn't have discovered these treasures on our own.</p>

<p>If all your guide books are at home the Bot, Julia, can be consulted and will provide useful information free of charge! Sometimes the information comes unprovoked. Thus...</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: If you're anywhere near St Paul's/Barbican   ...Postman's Park is an interesting little diversion ..and free</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: Which is close to the sunken The Goldsmiths' Garden - small but beautiful at this time of year and also free</p>

<p class="conversationtalk">Tony: Thanks, may do Museum of London in Barbican so that would fit in nicely.</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: Ooh yes, that's at No 1 London Walls - just round the corner. Also very close is Little Britain ( just a road really) but if you then walk say, after the museum, through Little Britain  and then take a dog leg through St Barts, toward Smithfield, you go past a very ancient church which is beautiful inside and out - I'll look up its name. .</p>

<p class="conversationtalk">Rachel: Julia  knows everything.</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: Turns out it's called St Bartholomews! !! anyway there's a St Bartholomews the Great and The Less, it's ancient and fabulous. There's stuff on Google about it.   And the dog leg is a right/left, not a left/right.</p>

<p class="conversationtalk">Rachel: Thank you! We have an exciting day ahead!</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: Then if you walked through Smithfield you could walk down St John Street /Road to St John's Gate which is not only the home of St John's ambulance but also the only original City gate still in tact and in its original position. This is very close to the Jerusalem inn -  best pub in London.  Also, the Three Kings in Clerkenwell is not far away - also a good pub. All thus is free except the pubs - obvs</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: If you do the St John's part of that walk,  just pop down Peter's Lane/White Horse Alley on your left to take a look at the building with cow/sheep heads going all the way up to the top.
Sorry, it's the Jerusalem Tavern not Inn and is closed at the weekends as it's in the city. Not far  to stumble then to Faringdon tube.</p>

<p class="conversationlisten">Julia: This is the only bit of London I know</p>

<p class="conversationtalk">Rachel: Fabulous, thank you!</p>

<p>Sightseeing tour sorted!</p>
