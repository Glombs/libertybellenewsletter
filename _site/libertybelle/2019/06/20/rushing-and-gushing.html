  <h2>From Paddington to Leamington Spa</h2>
<h2>1st - 21st June 2019</h2>

 <p>It's a beautiful day! Heading along the Grand Union towards the junction with the Wendover Arm.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Whilst we were travelling in and around London, the trees around us were busy with bright green parakeets, shouting at one another and generally making a lot of fuss! Otherwise we had our familiar heron, cormorants, gulls, ducks, geese, swans, moorhens and coots, many of them now in family groups.</p>

<p>City dwelling coots built their nests with colourful and interesting things woven amongst the twigs. Anything that floats was chosen from plastic bags and takeaway coffee cups to sweet wrappers and even a flip flop! Many of the nests were made on the back ends of boats and in tyres, suspended from boats as fenders. Some boats even had signs asking people not to double moor because they didn't want the coot nesting there to be disturbed!</p>

<p>Talking about wildlife using their initiative, I witnessed a crow catching a fish. He carried it from the canal in his beak to a nearby roof. I watched him as he ate it by pecking it to pieces rather than swallowing it head first as a water bird would have done. Well I never!</p>

 <p>Bye Bye Paddington.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We discovered that Paddington's bit of canal has a special bubble curtain which keeps rubbish out and aerates the water. It is a metal tube, full of small holes, formed into a rectangle and positioned on the bottom of the canal where it has air pumped through it. It is a strange sensation, passing over it in the boat. It feels like the boat has briefly levitated. A small boat which has a conveyor belt tipped over the front of it, removes the debris collected behind the bubble curtain so that it can be disposed of. Clever ol' Paddington! Very neat!</p>

<p>After waving goodbye to dear ol’ Paddington, we turned onto the Regents Canal.
I have always wanted to travel along here, through Little Venice, the park, the zoo and Camden Lock.</p>

<p>The only zoo animal we saw was a very large pig but apart from that, the journey didn’t disappoint.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful and Camden was packed with people, on the bridges, in the bars and cafes, along the towpath and even enjoying picnics on the locks themselves! We had to ask people to move all their belongings before we could use the steps and swing the gates. The buzzing crowd seemed to be in holiday mood, enjoying the sunshine.</p>

<p>We had hoped to moor at Limehouse, but there was no space for us so were forced to continue on. We finally found a place to moor at Bow Locks, just between the lock and the railway bridge. Whilst there we had a flying visit from Craig! Well, almost. He passed by us on a train, within a few feet of Liberty Belle!</p>

<p>We set off again the following morning and heard some lively music, which got louder and louder. Finally we came across the source, a boat crowded with people dancing. The party had spread to the outside of the boat and the tow path. We shouted across to them, asking if it was today's party or yesterday's. They confirmed it was yesterday's and invited us to join in. Feeling we would have a lot of catching up to do drink-wise, we waved cheerfully and declined...</p>

<p>We looped back to the Regents Canal, before retracing our journey to Little Venice and along Paddington’s Arm, before heading North along the Grand Onion.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the junction for the Slough Arm we slowed a little and just peered along it. We decided not to travel down it. Was that a mistake? Sorry Slough. Maybe next time.</p>

<p>We try to plan ahead to some degree, plotting roughly where we want to be and when. We had spent rather more time in London than we had foreseen, so now we needed to move along without the luxury of exploring every town and village on the way. However, we do still want to travel the whole of the network if possible, so we try to travel along any canal arms that we can on our way, so that we don't have to come back to complete these extra bits of the network in the future.</p>

<p>June had arrived and with it the heady smell of elderflowers, pretty pink wild roses draped over the hedges, waterlilies coming into bud and the occasional dragonfly.</p>

<p>As we left London behind we began to see Red Kites overhead, wagtails fussing around the locks and kingfishers dashing along in front of us again.</p>

<p>Approaching Rickmansworth we could hear chanting. Rather than disturbing the peace, the sound was hypnotic and relaxing, although we had no idea what it was for. We searched the internet later and it turned out to be 'Prayer in the Park' held in a marquee near the canal to celebrate the end of Ramadan. It is obviously a very popular and well attended event.</p>

<p>We joined forces with a pleasant young Londoner on his neat little boat with hops growing from pots at the bow. Apparently the hop plant doesn’t really like growing horizontally along the top of a boat but he was determined to make it work as he was brewing his own beer.
He was searching for a quiet mooring to leave his boat whilst he went for a week’s cider drinking in Cornwall.</p>

<p>A week in Cornwall? Now there's an idea...</p>

<p>We turned down the Wendover Arm, which is under restoration. It is navigable for about 1.5 miles of its 6.75 mile length. We moored Liberty Belle near Tring where the canal currently terminates. Between rain showers we had a quick look around the town and the Church of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul.  The next day the weather was better so we walked to Wendover, checking out the progress of the canal restoration.</p>

<p>For the return journey back to Liberty Belle we walked over a section of The Ridgeway from Wendover to Tring Park, which was a lovely discovery! The park used to belong to the Rothschilds. Walter Rothschild used to keep his wallabies, zebras, cassowaries and giant tortoises here in the late 1800’s.</p>

<p>Apparently he had trained some of the zebras to pull a cart and used to ride one of the tortoises around, encouraging it forwards with a lettuce leaf! Brilliant!</p>

<p>Now it is a haven for wildlife and has a network of well marked trails. After finding our way through the park we next discovered the Tring Natural History Museum (Walter Rothschild again) which took my breath away! For a small market town, Tring has a lot to offer!</p>

<p>On our way out of Tring, back to Liberty Belle, we almost managed to walk past the chippy...almost.</p>

<p>After returning to the main canal from the Wendover Arm we travelled down the next arm to Aylesbury. The first two locks on this arm form a short staircase; the second lock is filled by the water expelled from the first. This makes you stop and think for a moment before operating them!</p>

<p>Arriving at the third lock, the water was gushing into the lock over the gate at an alarming rate! I was convinced this must be my fault; I must have left the staircase lock in a state where the water was rapidly draining the canal! I dashed back to the staircase lock and couldn't see anything untoward, so we carried on down the locks, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all my fault. Every lock along the arm had an excess of water, whereas there was generally a shortage...</p>

<p>It was quite unnerving. We met some local people at a lock and I asked them if it was normal. They said it wasn't, and proceeded to take photos of the waterfall gushing over the lock gate. This wasn't reassuring. I asked them to forget that they had seen us, if it turned out to be my error!</p>

<p>After stopping over at Aylesbury we made our way back to the main canal. The water level was still very high all along the arm. Very odd - where was it all coming from?</p>

<p>As we made our way to Milton Keynes, the weather took a turn! So far on our adventure we have only had occasional days of rain, but now we had a full week of it! We couldn't allow it to put us off as we had arranged to collect Cathy.</p>

<p>Some months before, I had been talking to a lock keeper about the lack of water and had suggested that maybe it would rain for the whole of June, to make up for it. Hmmmm...</p>

<p>We made good time, despite the weather. Cathy, on the other hand, had a difficult journey to Milton Keynes, having trains delayed and cancelled en route, but she got there in the end!</p>

<p>There had been some doubt about our journey beyond Milton Keynes because one of the locks was closed due to damage caused by an 'accidental collision' and a tree had been blown down across the canal. Thankfully the Canal &amp; River Trust was able to complete the work required before it affected us. Well done to them!</p>

<p>The weather continued to be rather wet over the next few days but, with Cathy's help, we made good time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony had been fighting with his GPS tracker that turned out not to be as waterproof as we had thought. It failed to plot chunks of our journey so Tony had to manipulate the Liberty Belle maps himself.</p>

<p>Cathy had to leave us at Norton Junction, to make her way back to Bristol. This time her train journey was straightforward, thankfully.</p>

<p>This area between Berkhamsted and Milton Keynes is so unexpectedly delightful that we are thinking of coming back in the winter, to have more time to explore properly.</p>

<p>Our next assignment was to get to Leamington Spa.</p>

<p>We ticked off the miles and locks with ease. The Yellow Flag Irises that have cheered us along our way are gradually dying back but we are now accompanied by an array of flowers of different colours and shades, including bright red poppies, cheerful Ox-eye Daisies and the determined Red Valerian.</p>

<p>On the last day the sun finally came out. We completed the locks and miles in good time and arrived in Leamington Spa, looking for a safe place to moor Liberty Belle near the railway station. We found a stretch along the towpath which wasn't included in the 48 hour mooring signs, so we decided that Liberty Belle could legitimately stay here for a while.</p>

<p>She can have a break whilst Tony and I go to Cornwall for a well earned rest. (?)</p>
