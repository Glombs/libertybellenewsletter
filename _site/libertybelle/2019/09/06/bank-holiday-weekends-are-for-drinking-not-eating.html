<p>After restocking the boat stores we left Leeds behind, with a promise from Cathy that she would join us for the Bank Holiday weekend at a little place called Saltaire.</p>

<p>After a brief section on the RIver Aire, we were back onto a proper canal, surely this should be easy. Our first surprise was the strange mechanisms for opening the locks. There is always something new!</p>

 <p>On the other side it was 12:00.</p>
 <p>Magic!</p>

 <p>At least I can see the mechanism and how it works.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We travelled along, watching the dragonflies darting and dancing around Liberty Belle, even investigating indoors, briefly. The swallows spent their days swooping overhead and the evenings darting around close to the canal water. The towpaths are beautifully kept and wide enough for walkers, runners and cyclists to co-exist. Consequently they are well used.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day when we finally arrived at Saltaire. The village is named after the man who created it, Titus Salt, and the River Aire which runs though it. Titus Salt made his money in the textile industry in Bradford where he owned several mills. Disgusted by the conditions in which his employees lived, he built a new mill on a plot between the railway and canal on the banks of the River Aire which replaced his Bradford Mills. At the same time he built an entire village for his workers; houses, shops, church, school, hospital, almshouses, reading rooms, bath houses, entertainment hall and a recreation park. The mill is now used as a retail centre, an art gallery, business space and housing.</p>

<p>The whole village has been very well kept and is delightful.</p>

<p>Here we collected Cathy from the railway station and had a brief visit from Garry and Helen.</p>

<p>After lunch we all went for a stroll and an ice-cream for pudding. Tony and I, in our wisdom, decided to have the 'special' - black vanilla. The ice-cream was indeed black. It stained our mouths and the front of my dress! Taste-wise it was vaguely vanilla flavoured and really not worth the bother...</p>

<p>On Sunday we decided to treat ourselves to a pub roast dinner. At the appropriate time of day, we moored up and investigated the local pubs. None of them were serving food at all over the Bank Holiday.</p>

<p>What? Really?</p>

<p>'Fraid so...</p>

<p>A friendly couple on the towpath had recommended a pub just a few miles further along the canal so we set off in Liberty Belle to find it, hoping we would get there before they stopped serving...</p>

<p>Well, we did find it but their kitchen was closed too. What is it with these people? Instead we had a pint and some crisps in the pub, an organ recital in the local church and a cream tea in the village hall.</p>

<p>After these delights we set off again.</p>

<p>We found a mooring in Skipton and went in search of some dinner - we felt we deserved something special after the Sunday Lunch nonsense!</p>

<p>After much discussion we settled for the Skipton Balti House. It was definitely the correct decision. After much pondering over the menu we had the most delicious meal.</p>

<p>We spent the following day exploring the delights of the lovely Skipton before saying goodbye to Cathy, who had to catch her train back home. We all agreed that it was a town worth visiting.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We are due to arrive in Liverpool on 11th September, leaving on the 15th with Mary as extra crew! We plan to visit Chester, Ellesmere Port and Stone during her visit. We have a vague plan of visiting the house sometime in October.</p>
