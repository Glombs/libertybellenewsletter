<p>The 24th April is Tonyâ€™s birthday! After opening his card (not from me, you understand) and hanging it up, we moved Liberty Belle nearer to Bath Spa station and went food shopping.</p>

<p>By 11:30 we were waiting at the station for Mary to arrive. We had 2 exits covered but she came out at the third! She nearly went to Leamington Spa, (we are still not sure whether it was her mistake or that of the ticket office) so it could have been worse.</p>

<p>My cousin, Robyn, caught up with us in the afternoon so we had a long chat, a cuppa and a stroll to take in the views. We all agreed that she lives in a lovely city!</p>

 <p>On both visits to Bath, Liberty Belle spent some time moored next to this sundial. If the sun was shining, we could see what time it was...Oh well, we'll call it lunch time, just in case.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following morning, Rose joined us for second breakfast. After opening his second birthday card and hanging it up, we all set off for Keynsham. Rose volunteered to help me fight with some of the locks which sped up the proceedings, particularly for the deep lock in Bath.</p>

<p>Along the way we attempted to tie up outside one of the Canal &amp; River Trust facilities moorings, which was tricky due to certain boats being permanently moored there....</p>

<p>Along the canals, the Canal &amp; River Trust provide certain facilities for boaters. These consist of one or more of the following:- a water tap; elsan disposal; toilet tank pump out; toilets; rubbish bins; recycling facilities (rare); showers (very rare). Boats should only moor at these facilities for the short time it takes to use them.</p>

<p>In areas where people are likely to want to stay, near shops and pubs, visitor moorings are provided which are restricted to a specified number of days. As there are very few of them on the Kennet &amp; Avon, these moorings are usually restricted to 1 or 2 days. It is very difficult to moor alongside the towpath on this canal because the boats become grounded before they are close enough to the edge for the crew to alight. As a consequence of this, many of the visitor moorings (and even facilities moorings) have been adopted as permanent moorings, disregarding the restrictions. This is very frustrating....</p>

<p>As we travelled along Rose was able to point out beauty and colours where I only saw rusty bridges and dilapidated walls... This journey is wasted on me. Maybe someone should write a Rose App that enables you to film things as you go along and points out how beautiful it all is. Or maybe I should just learn to observe...</p>

<p>We kept our eyes peeled for a lunch time mooring but found nothing until Keynsham, at about 3pm, where we took the last remaining visitor mooring. Rose had to leave us there and catch a train home, a little later than she had planned. Thank you, Rose, for a lovely day.</p>

 <p>Bath Deep Lock</p>
 <p>Just look at the height of those gates! They are so heavy that they are opened &amp; closed using a winding mechanism, not pushed like the others. This seems to take forever....</p>
 <p>Bath Deep Lock is the second deepest lock in the country at 19ft 5ins (we didn't measure it ourselves...). It has the combined depth of the two locks that it replaced during the restoration of the canal in 1976. A road was built over the original site of one of those locks.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bristol Harbour is tidal, so, before entering the harbour, it is necessary to contact the Harbour Master or the keeper of the tidal lock to get permission to continue. Tony attempted several times to book our passage through the lock into the harbour. When he finally managed to get through, he informed them that one of their numbers didn't seem to work at all. The lock keeper was surprised that the number was still being given out as it belonged to a phone that had fallen into the lock a year ago... Well, no wonder.</p>

<p>The lock itself had been left open but we needed to stop and buy our Bristol Harbour licence. We tied up, making sure we avoided a pole sticking out horizontally from the pontoon looking all the world like an eye-poker-outer. It turned out that the pole had been put there at the same height as the lowest bridge in the harbour to indicate whether we would fit under it or not. It was going to be a tight squeeze, but it wouldn't need to be lifted.</p>

<p>With our 3 day licence, some indication of where we could moor and the advice to 'navigate the bridges as best you know', off we went.</p>

<p>As we got closer the rain poured down in torrents. We contacted Cathy and she confirmed that there was mooring space outside the 'Vegetable Diva', where she works. Hurray!</p>

<p>As we tried to moor the wind picked up and kept Liberty Belle pinned against the end of one of the pontoon 'fingers' that we were trying to swing past. The lady operating the ferry took pity on us, stood on the end of the 'finger' and heaved Liberty Belle past it and into our mooring. Well done and many thanks to her.</p>

<p>Cathy, who was just finishing her break, saw us arrive and rushed out to greet us but had to immediately return to work.  As it was getting late we stopped to have lunch on the boat before visiting Cathy at her place of work for a coffee. We immediately realised that we should have saved ourselves for something from the cafe because the savoury treats looked absolutely wonderful. I was determined that we would buy some of them the following day. After finishing work Cathy joined us on Liberty Belle for the evening.</p>

<p>The wind only got worse overnight. As the waves thrashed against the side of the boat, it sounded like an ogre was tramping up and down on the roof, moaning and groaningâ€¦ Mary got up a couple of times in the night to check that we werenâ€™t untied and floating off out to sea!</p>

<p>Despite all the noise, we got through the night unscathed.</p>

<p>In the morning Cathy and Will escorted us as we were blown around Bristol for the day, dodging in and out of museums, shops and cafes. Joe managed to track us down and joined us for lunch, making 6 of us, quite a family gathering! This could have been tricky in Mokoko, but we managed to commandeer the only table large enough for us in the cafe - Cathy and I can look quite threatening when necessary! Later we all returned to Liberty Belle for the evening.</p>

<p>The following morning the weather was comparatively calm. There were several rowing teams out on the water. Joe joined us for the morning for a coffee in Pinkmans and a look around the excellent Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.</p>

<p>Will joined us for lunch at the Christmas Steps pub, after which Joe set off for home and we, (Tony, Mary and myself) set off for the SS Great Britain. We found plenty to interest us en route and by the time we arrived it was almost time for Cathy to finish work. We got straight onto the ferry back to Liberty Belle and I rushed to buy a few yummy things for tea time from her in the â€˜Vegetable Divaâ€™. Soon afterwards Cathy arrived with more nice things to eat, shortly followed by Will with even more goodies, so we shared a delicious feast.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning Cathy returned to Liberty Belle and became our helmsman for a couple of days. We had planned to moor at Keynsham the first night but there was no space for us so we had to carry on all the way to Bath where we moored on the river. Well done Cathy!</p>

 <p>No, we haven't taken a wrong turn and ended up in the Everglades but we have found a turtle! (Cathy gets the prize for spotting him)</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We wandered around Bath, taking in the sights, including the Abbey and covered market. We ate excellent pies in The Raven at lunch time, then, in the afternoon, Cathy took Liberty Belle through the 3 locks to the mooring space we had used the the week before. During the evening Cathy had to leave us and caught the train back to Bristol.</p>

<p>Mary, Tony and I joined a free walking tour of Bath, available every day and worth every penny! We had a very pleasant and knowledgeable guide who kept us interested for over 2 hours. In the afternoon, Tony and I left Mary on Liberty Belle, reading her book, whilst we went for a walk uphill to get some views of Bath. We do like this city and are already planning to return (probably by train to avoid cruising back through Reading...).</p>

<p>After the success of Wednesday's tour we decided to stay for another day and join a different tour, which was also interesting. Feeling that we had now seen some of Bath and maybe learnt a little bit about it, we set off in the afternoon. Before long the weather turned and we got soaked to the skin! We moored up as soon as we found a space, because we couldnâ€™t take any more. We found ourselves in Bathampton for the night, just 2 miles and 3 locks away from our Bath mooring. Oh well!</p>
