  <h2>From Bathampton to Bradford-on-Avon</h2>
<h2>3rd - 8th May 2019</h2>

<p>After leaving Bath we, (Tony, Mary and myself), decided it would be nice to moor up near to the Dundas Aqueduct and take a stroll across it before visiting the nearby village of Monkton Coombe. Having checked our map to find the number of the bridge nearest to the aqueduct, we travelled along until we reached that bridge and moored nearby.</p>

<p>We set off for our walk. We walked on... and on... much further than we had expected. It turned out that the bridges on the map had been incorrectly numbered! Good grief.</p>

 <p>We first saw this boat when several Europeans, (Germans, I think), were posing in front of it, laughing and taking photos...</p>

<p>Finally we arrived at the aqueduct, shook off the Canal &amp; River Trust chappy (who wanted us to donate on a monthly basis) and walked into Monkton Coombe for a little look around. We then had a nice big lunch to prepare us for the walk back...</p>

<p>On the up side, we were moored closer to the historic Claverton Pumping Station than we had expected and the volunteers were going to be running it whilst we were there, so the next morning we set off to investigate. After an interesting look around we were about to leave when we were offered a guided tour. The young man that guided us made it all even more fascinating, so it was well worth the visit.</p>

<p>The pump was built to feed water from the river into the canal above. It is driven by a water wheel, rotated by the flow of the river. Unfortunately, the water cannot now be pumped into the canal because the modern pumping station uses the same pipes and cannot be disrupted. This means the pumped water is piped back into the river, behind the wheel, which gives the impression of the station "lifting itself up by its own boot straps".</p>

<p>Whilst we were here, Mary spotted a fox running alongside the canal, so we were able to add him to our list of wildlife spotted on our journey.</p>

<p>We cruised along, finally reaching the Dundas Aqueduct where we stopped to take on water. Suddenly there was a great kerfuffle in a nearby hedge. A woman passing by investigated and tried to intervene. Tony too, went to have a look. A magpie was being ineffectually attacked by a pair of blackbirds as it ate the contents of their nest. The woman trying to 'shoo' it away didn't have any effect either. I know it's just nature, but I am glad I didn't witness it.</p>

<p>On that sad note, we crossed this aqueduct and moored just before the next one at Avoncliff. We had a quick look around and decided we would have a better look and a pub lunch the following day.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Tony went for an early walk the next morning to look at the mooring possibilities in Bradford-on-Avon and came back full of enthusiasm for moving on because there were a couple of spaces in a prime position, so Avoncliff's delights would have to wait for another visit...
(We did, however, get our pub lunch, in Bradford-on-Avon.)</p>

<p>We took Mary for a look around the town, including the Tithe Barn and three very different churches. One Norman church (laid out very much in the way we expect and visited by us on our first visit to Bradford-on-Avon), one fascinating Saxon church (nothing like any others we have seen) and one which had been built as a town hall originally, rejected by the town, adopted by the Catholic church and looking very much like a town hall.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>The use of the Saxon Church in Bradford on Avon is not in doubt but its age is. It was built somewhere between the 8th and the 11th century. What's 300 years between friends?</p>

</figure>

<p>The following day we had visitors! Claire and Keith came to meet Liberty Belle and have a look around Bradford-on-Avon. The weather did us proud so they were able to see the town at it's best. We visited the Bradford-on-Avon Millennium Embroidery, the Iron Duke Rubber Roller (or Calendar, confusingly), the reconstructed old Chemist shop in the museum (exactly like the one Mary used to work in), and the Secret Garden Cafe for you-know-what. After a lovely day they set off for home, taking Tony with them!

<p>Whist Tony was at the house, weeding the drive, Mary and I had a final look around Bradford-on-Avon and a pub lunch (this is becoming a habit!) before Mary caught her train home. I was suddenly alone...</p>

<p>The weather was still sunny so I decided not to waste it and went for a walk to Avoncliff, to see what we had missed. Well, nothing, as it turned out!</p>

<p>I decided to walk back on a footpath along the river, next to the canal. It was all very lovely with the added excitement of a living-willow labyrinth and a pond, teeming with tadpoles.</p>

<p>Wednesday's weather was in complete contrast, with rain, hail and thunderstorms. Tony gave up gardening and took the train back to Liberty Belle where we sat out the bad weather, planning our next move...</p>
