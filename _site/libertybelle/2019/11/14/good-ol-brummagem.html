  <h2>From Nantwich to Birmingham</h2>

<p>We left Nantwich on a misty autumn morning with lots of locks ahead of us. The canal was busy and so there was a lot of waiting around for Liberty Belle but it is always nice to chat at the locks and help each other through. It had been a long and tiring day and the sky began to look threatening before we arrived at our planned mooring. We tied up for the night before the last two locks on the Audlem flight, just in time for the rain to start!</p>

<p>At the locks I had heard rumours of cake so, whilst Tony put the kettle on, I dashed up to the top of the flight to investigate. Sure enough I found a covered stall on a garden wall with various cakes, bagged up in pairs, a price list and an honesty box. What a wonderful idea. I chose lemon drizzle...</p>

<p>On the way back I helped a single-handed boater through the last lock and passed on the information about cake. He was suitably excited about the news!  Then I took my treasure indoors before I got too wet!</p>

<p>We spent the evening in the Shroppie Fly pub, just a few locks down from our mooring and treated ourselves to a delicious meal. Apart from some lads playing pool in the other bar, we were the only customers. Considering the quality of the food, this seemed a real shame, but I suppose it was a school night...</p>

<p>Off the next day to Market Drayton, with plenty of locks to do again. We eagerly checked the cake stall as we passed by but were disappointed to find it empty. As we reached a bend in the canal we looked over our shoulders just in time to see an elderly gentleman carrying cake boxes to the stall. Noooooo, too late!</p>

<p>The canal was busy but the boats were well choreographed, one up, one down, one up, one down... Ideal!</p>

<p>We made it to Market Drayton in no time and looked for somewhere to tie up. We pulled over at some mooring rings and read the notice. Mooring was allowed on this stretch of the canal on market day and the day before, Wednesdays and Tuesdays....  We discussed this for an embarrassingly long time but came to the conclusion that it was Tuesday and so we tied up.</p>

<p>Due to our early arrival at Market Drayton and the good weather that afternoon, we managed to service Liberty Belle's engine. Not only that, but the engine still seemed to work afterwards! We were pleased with ourselves until we discovered that the battery inverter, which provides 240V electricity for the TV and my hairdryer, no longer worked.  What on earth could we have done?</p>

<p>After much discussion and checking Tony managed to convince me that it must be a coincidence...</p>

<p>Tony with a beard and me without a hairdryer, personal grooming is at an all-time low.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>So really, it was an educational visit.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following morning we set off in the autumn sunshine. We were travelling through a tunnel of trees, with insects busy in the shafts of sunlight and leaves falling all around us, catching the light as they tumbled. Beautiful.</p>

<p>Then the hard work began, with some difficult locks. The advice for operating the Tyrley Flight is to keep the boat in the previous lock whilst setting the next, because of the strong sidewash across the front of each one. This way the boat can be driven at top speed towards the source of the sidewash which will then turn the bow towards the open lock gates....(If the boat is left to drift in the pound it will be too difficult to approach the next lock at the right angle.)</p>

<p>The crew member thus needs to walk ahead, set the lock, open the gates, walk back to the previous lock, shut the gate, back to the current lock, shut the gate.....etc</p>

<p>The locks were far enough apart to make this a slow, laborious process.
We also had a boat just in front of us, which meant we needed to empty each lock again before we could use it. The chap in front took pity on us and, when he could, after leaving the lock, he would wind up a paddle to start to drain it for us. This made life a lot easier.</p>

<p>Later in the day the battery warning light came on so we had to pull over and have a look. It seems, in our attempt to inspect and tighten the alternator belt we had, in fact, managed to loosen it!</p>

<p>The following morning,Tony replaced the alternator belt with one of his spares and all was well. (We have plenty of spares of everything for the engine because it is so difficult to buy them at a reasonable price when travelling around).</p>

<p>We then had a short journey into Wheaton Aston where we knew that one of the locks was being repaired and wasn't due to open until that afternoon. When we investigated, the workmen were obviously still busy and told us that it may take longer than forecast, possibly until the following afternoon, so we prepared to stay there for a day or maybe more...</p>

<p>A hire boat, that we had seen several times over the past couple of days, moored up behind us and were surprised to learn that the lock was closed for repair. We were shocked that the hire firm hadn't warned them, as it had been planned for some time. They were quite upbeat about it though and one of the women was actually pleased as it would give her a chance to have her hair done.</p>

<p>Whilst we waited we visited the village but there was very little to see. We checked the vegetable options in both shops and found we had a choice of cauliflower or.... cauliflower. We also looked for a hairdresser for our new friend but there wasn't one.</p>

<p>On the way back to the canal we met our boating neighbours and informed them that the village had just a Co-op and a Spar. The woman's eyes lit up! A Spa! Wonderful! Her dreams had come true.... We were a bit baffled then realised the mistake. No, no. A 'So-near-so-Spar', not a health spa. What a disappointment.</p>

<p>As it turned out the lock opened that evening but we stayed overnight and left first thing the following morning.</p>

<p>We were both looking forward to being back in Brumm but first we had to get through the 21 locks at Wolverhampton. We thought these might be rather industrial and run down but were pleasantly surprised. They we all very neat, well kept and easy to operate. About half way up the set of locks we came across a busy work party hoeing, weeding, sweeping and rubbish picking. Wow! This was Wolverhampton's secret - a well supported community payback scheme!</p>

<p>Most canals approaching cities are rather grim but around Birmingham there are many beautiful sections.</p>

<p>We eventually arrived in Birmingham and found a 14 day mooring next to some residential boats and near the Canal &amp; River Trust offices. We always feel safe in good ol' Brummagem, but this mooring felt especially so. We decided that we no longer needed to get to Leamington Spa before going back to the house as we were already in the ideal place.</p>

<p>After getting a few jobs done and meeting up with Julia for a delightful lunch, we were fortunate enough to get a lift all the way back to the house where the garden was awaiting our attention...</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>Tony has booked Liberty Belle into a boatyard near Coventry for the first week in December to have her propeller repaired. We will be heading back to the house whilst she is in the dry dock.</p>

<p>In the meantime we are exploring the canals around Birmingham.</p>
