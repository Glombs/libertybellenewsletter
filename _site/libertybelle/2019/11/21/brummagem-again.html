  <h2>Birmingham</h2>
<h2>4th - 13th November 2019</h2>

<figure>

 <figcaption>
 <p>Tony made us new windlass &amp; mooring pin holders.</p>
 <p>Posh.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After getting a few jobs done at the house, we returned to Birmingham, dropping off the faulty inverter on the way. Having already been moored for our 14 day allocation, we were ready to move Liberty Belle straight away and make room for another boat.</p>

<p>When we arrived we noticed that the other 14 day moorings were empty, so there certainly wasn't a queue! Tony contacted the Canal &amp; River Trust to see whether they would allow us to stay until we had our inverter back from the repairers. They were agreeable, which meant Tony could easily travel by train to collect it. Fab!</p>

<p>So, whilst we waited, we had a good look around the building site which is Birmingham City Centre. We do love Birmingham but it is surrounded by hoardings, scaffolding and apologies! I overheard someone saying that to get anywhere in Birmingham you have to go the long way round. That is so true.</p>

<p>Alongside exploring churches and museums, the Central Library and Botanic Gardens we were there to witness the switching on of the Christmas lights and the start of the German Christmas market, as well as the Remembrance Sunday Parade.</p>

<p>Last year we attended a  Remembrance Sunday service around a village memorial, which was a small and very personal affair. This year, in the middle of a city, it was on a much larger scale and very formal. Very different and yet the same.</p>

<p>We also included the occasional trip to the Briar Rose (our nearest Wetherspoons), The Wellington Specialist Real Ale Pub (of course) and the Damascena Coffee House, (my personal favourite).</p>

<p>Whilst we were here, Tony also took the opportunity to try and book Liberty Belle into a boatyard to have her propeller fixed. He chose a convenient boatyard and contacted the number. After some confusing phone calls where he was sent around from one phone number to another until he came full circle, he tried another boatyard. Here he had more success. Now that we had a date we could plan our next few weeks of travel. We decided we had enough time to explore the Birmingham Canals before heading for the Coventry area for Liberty Belle's dry-dock booking.</p>

<p>Having had the call to say our inverter was ready for collection, Tony went by train to fetch it. It had been the switch that was broken. The nice engineer said there was no charge, so Tony handed him some beer money and both were happy.</p>

<p>Once it was back in position and working, we were off. There is a very complicated network of canals around Birmingham and Tony had planned a route that would enable us to travel along most of them.</p>

<p>It felt good to be on the move again.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We are still chugging around Birmingham and will be heading to the boatyard in time for Liberty Belle's dry-dock 'appointment'.
We had hoped to have time to explore the Ashby Canal on the way but that will now have to wait until next year....</p>
