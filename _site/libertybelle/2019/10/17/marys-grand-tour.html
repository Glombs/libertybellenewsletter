  <h2>From Liverpool to Chester</h2>

<p>Here we were in Liverpool! This compact city snuggles right up to the docks, so we were ideally positioned for exploring.</p>

<p>However, before we could do any sightseeing, we had a few jobs to do in preparation for Mary's visit. Mainly laundry, shopping and housework (or boatwork).</p>

<p>In our Salthouse Dock mooring we had free electric hook-up! So exciting!</p>

<p>We used Liberty Belle's vacuum cleaner for the first time to prepare the boat for our honoured guest and, because the overnight temperatures were beginning to feel rather autumnal, Tony bought an electric heater for the princely sum of £6, which worked a treat!</p>

<figure>

 <figcaption>
 <p>Laundry? There's an app for that!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After a slightly complicated journey by train, Mary finally arrived in Liverpool to meet us. The weather was on our side so we spent the next couple of days exploring the city on foot and by open-top bus.</p>

<p>We like Liverpool. It is a friendly, interesting and clean city which is busy and bustling without being cramped and has fascinating buildings, both ancient and modern, sitting harmoniously side by side.</p>

 <p>Here they come, walking down the street..!</p>
 <p>Oh no, hang on, that's another lot.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We visited Liverpool's Catholic Cathedral which is truly a place of two contrasting halves! Its foundations were built to a traditional, vaulted design, but the construction was interrupted by war. By the time the building resumed they had a very different design, so above ground it is shockingly modern...!</p>

<p>From the outside the Cathedral appears to promise a light, airy and colourful inside space but I was personally disappointed, finding it remarkably gloomy. I couldn't help comparing it to the Coventry Cathedral which I much prefer. However, the story of it's construction was fascinating and well presented.</p>

 <p>The space is huge. The original plans for the Cathedral were, to say the least, dramatic.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We popped into Liverpool's Central Library as we were passing by. My goodness, this building is amazing! It is modern and traditional, calm and exciting. Tony and I both thought that we could live here just to have daily access to this place.</p>

<p>The children's section is shaped like an amphitheatre, with steps all around, scattered with bean bags and a stage in the middle. When we were there a little girl was performing ballet moves on the stage for her mother's entertainment.</p>

<p>The hushed Reading Room has beautiful wooden bookcases with steps and walkways to give access to the higher shelves. The lobby, oh my goodness, is modern and wonderful with escalators zig-zagging into the sky above your head.</p>

<p>Two days wasn't long enough to do justice to the lovely Liverpool, but we had other plans...

<p>We were looking forward to Chester but that was nearly 2 weeks away. In the meantime we had the excitement of tunnels and swing bridges, the surprisingly lovely Wigan, the free bits of the Dunham Massey Hall and the amazing Anderton Boat Lift.</p>

<p>In between these wonders Mum and I walked the towpath for exercise for a while each day and then sat in the bow watching for kingfishers and other wildlife. We even saw a turtle basking in the sunshine on a log.</p>

<p>We gingerly moored up in Wigan to have a look around. We set off to find the town and weren't quite sure of the route. We stopped two young lads and asked them. They were friendly and helpful despite being a little confused as they couldn't think what we could possibly see there!</p>

<p>Actually, we were pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>The new shopping arcades in the town have been tastefully built to blend in with the old buildings. The library/museum was welcoming and interesting; we certainly couldn't fault the enthusiasm of the staff.</p>

<p>The town is trying very hard to envelop the residents in arts projects. The people of Wigan have collaborated to create a manifesto entitled 'The Fire Within' which is an attempt to boost local culture, bring life back to the town centre and encourage local talent. Some empty shops are being used as galleries to display artefacts from the museum's collections as well as projects from local clubs and schools. Other unused units are now performance space for local groups and individuals to show off their talents in front of their family, friends, neighbours and visitors. Poetry recitals, dance, music, theatre all take place in the arcade.</p>

<p>As a result of all these events, a local family have been able to open a successful new cafe in one of the empty spaces, providing refreshments for all the visitors. Go Wigan!</p>

<p>On our way we found a pretty mooring space opposite a lake. This turned out to be the Pennington Flash Country Park, created by subsidence after the collapse of salt mines in the area. These 'flashes' seem to be scattered all over the landscape around here.
Along the canal there are unexpectedly wide sections created the same way.</p>

<p>The Flashes, or lakes, are now used for local leisure and wildlife. There are well kept footpaths and seating areas around the park and plenty of waterfowl to watch. According to the two local men we met on a walk around the lake, there is also a well used hide nearby where birds are fed regularly and provide a good show. We stood with them for a while watching the many cormorants and Great Crested Grebes on the lake. Apparently they are the reason the men no longer fish here, they cannot compete!</p>

<p>In the 1720's the Worsley coal mines used underground water channels to drain the mines and transport the coal on long, narrow boats out into the open. With the rise in demand for coal in Manchester, these 'navigations' were extended and the resulting Bridgewater Canal was opened in 1761. It was the first canal which did not follow the course of an existing river and was fed by the drainage water from the mines. This is where it all began!</p>

<p>It is still privately owned and has its own solution to keeping the canal clear of rubbish, a boat called the Waterwomble, which patrols the canal, lifting out anything undesirable as it goes for either recycling or disposal. We asked in passing where the nearest rubbish collection point was and they told us to just sling our rubbish bag on-board, which we did! What service!</p>

<p>The Bridgewater canal has no locks because it follows the contours of the land which made the life of Liberty Belle's crew rather easy. It has other distinctive features including regular gates set into the canal sides, presumably used to isolate sections of the canal for drainage and repair. Also, at each bridge there is a crane ready to slide wooden boards across the canal for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The most exciting section of the Bridgewater Canal is the Barton Swing Aquaduct which has carried it over the Manchester Ship Canal since 1894. It swivels in the middle to allow ships to pass below. How amazing is that?</p>

<p>Our travels took us to Dunham Massey Hall, a National Trust property adjacent to the canal. How exciting! We love to explore historic houses!</p>

<p>Sadly it was closed on the day of our visit. Typical. However, as it was a lovely day and we were so close, we decided to go and be nosey anyway. To our delight we discovered more than enough to keep us interested. There was the old watermill, the stables, the deer park and even ice-cream!</p>

<p>On our journey to Chester we were due to pass by the Anderton Boat Lift. This wonderful machine carries boats vertically between the canal and the River Weaver, 50 feet below. The alternative would have been a series of locks but the water loss involved when emptying the locks from the canal down to the river would not have been sustainable.</p>

<p>We had no reason to be on the river but we couldn't resist a ride! Tony booked us a trip down and then back up again in the same morning.
We were sooo lucky with the weather. The whole process took ages and I wouldn't recommend it as part of a commute to work but as a ride it was wonderful!</p>

<p>We finally arrived in Chester. Despite the rain, the town still looked promising, so we decided to stay for a couple of days in the hope that the weather would change and we would have the chance to explore....</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>I am sorry that my newsletters are taking soooo long to compile, not only have we been busy travelling, we have been having some network and data problems on the way. Excuses, excuses!</p>

<p>We are now on our way South, heading for Birmingham and planning to pop back to the house on or around the 24th October to get a few jobs done and collect some warmer clothes...</p>

<p>Beyond that, we hope to spend the winter around the Milton Keynes area. More details will follow when we have worked them out...</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, the juddering we are experiencing is due to a bent propeller blade. Liberty Belle will need to be lifted out of the water for that to be fixed, so it will be a winter job.</p>
