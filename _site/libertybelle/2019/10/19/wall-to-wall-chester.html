  <h2>Chester and Ellesemere Port</h2>

<p>Wow! Chester! Where do you begin? The Cathedral, Roman Amphitheatre, Castle, Roodee (?), city walls....?</p>

<p>The obvious thing to do first is to walk the city walls but the weather wasn't very nice when we arrived so we put that off until the following day when it was due to be fine.</p>

<p>So we started by exploring the shops. But these are not just shops, they are the fascinating and decorative Medieval Rows. These buildings have shops a step or two below street level, then a second level of shops above these with steps up to them and a walkway along the front. This walkway is roofed by the storey above which juts out and is supported on pillars. These buildings stretch along both sides of four streets in the centre of Chester. Amazing! What more could you want on a rainy day?</p>

<p>Sadly, as with most town centres at the moment, rather a lot of the shops were empty. They need to take a leaf out of Wigan's book...</p>

<p>Next was Chester's Cathedral. We joined a guided tour which was absolutely fascinating. The Cathedral was wonderful to look at but so much more wonderful when we had some of it explained. Here are just a few of the very many photos we took...</p>

 <p>(Well, some sort of cocoon fabric...)</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cathedral began as the abbey church of a Benedictine monastery. The quire stalls are elaborately carved with a misericord seat, each with a separate canopy above, for each of the 48 monks of the monastery. Apparently the subject of the carvings on the seats were not allowed to be taken from the Bible because it would have been disrespectful to sit on them, so mythical characters were used. Many carpenters were involved and each design had to be approved by the monastery before they were made.</p>

<p>That evening, Tony and I decided to go back to the Cathedral for Evensong. The atmosphere in a place of worship during a service adds another dimension to the building and it is just nice to appreciate the space when it is being used in the way it was intended. In a village church it can feel a bit intrusive but in a Cathedral it seems more appropriate. We enjoyed the experience very much, especially as we were directed to sit in the monks' seats behind the choir. The sad thing was that the congregation was outnumbered by those taking the service.</p>

<p>The following day we set off along Chester's City Walls. Begun by the Romans, updated in Medieval times and repaired regularly ever since, the two mile walk gives the perfect vantage point from which to view the City.</p>

<p>Abutting the walls is Chester's Roodee Race Track. This area was a Roman port which became filled in with silt. Then it was used as a sports ground but in 1533 the football games became so violent that they were banned. They were replaced by horse racing by the consent of the Mayor of the time, Henry Gee, of gee-gee fame! Yes, it's true!</p>

<p>On our way to Chester we had met a man who recommended the Telford's Warehouse pub. Our walk along the walls just happened to take us there at around lunch time, so we popped in and Mary treated us. Mmmm. The food was very good indeed, not to mention the beer. Thanks Mary!
Telford's Warehouse.</p>

 <p>Tony's dinner was big but not as massive as it looks in this photo!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As if all this wasn't enough, we popped into the Grosvenor museum where lots of Roman artifacts are displayed and, in the adjoining Number 20 Castle Street, there is a series of nine period rooms dating from 1680 to 1925.</p>

<p>Having spent two weeks travelling on Liberty Belle, Mary took the train home from Chester. We kept her company on her first train, to Crewe. We wondered what Crewe would have to offer...</p>

<p>Second breakfast, it turned out, in the form of Staffordshire Oat Cakes filled with a full English! This was a first for us but certainly not a last.</p>

<p>The two of us arrived back in Chester and sheltered from the rain in Chester's first Cathedral, St Johns. which was well worth a visit. We then had a closer look at the Roman amphitheatre and garden before returning to Liberty Belle.</p>

 <p>A bit of shopping.</p>
 <p>New shoes?</p>
 <p>Oh yes!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mary must have known that the weather was about to take a real turn for the worse...my goodness we had a lot of rain over the next several days.</p>

<p>We left Chester behind for a couple of days whilst we went to Ellesmere Port, where they have a Museum dedicated to canals, barges and narrow boats. We didn't know what to expect but it turned out to be fascinating. We spent a whole day there, dodging in and out of the buildings to avoid the heavy showers. There was technical information about canals, locks, bridges and boats as well as social history concerning navvies, boat builders, boaters and all the other people needed at the wharves.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>It must have been exhausting!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We spent the night moored in Ellesmere Port then made our way back to Chester. It was pouring with rain (again), so where better to sit it out than Telford's Warehouse...?</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>
<p>We are popping back to the house next week to get some jobs done...
Once we are re-united with Liberty Belle we will probably stay in the Midlands until we head for the Milton Keynes area for the winter.</p>
