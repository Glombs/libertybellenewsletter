<p>Finally, from 12th April, we are obliged to move.</p>

<p>Up until  now we have been allowed to move for essential journeys only. At first this meant popping to the tap and elsan point, maybe staying there for a night or two, then returning to Westport Lake.</p>

 <figcaption>
 <p>We visited some nearby piglets occasionally for something different to do.</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Eventually the lack of bedding, (and the bulging laundry bag making it difficult to keep the hall cupboard doors shut), made a trip to a washing machine into an essential journey. We do most of our washing by hand but we have nowhere to hang out anything as big as a bed sheet.</p>

<p>The outdoor machine we had used in Endon was no longer available to us because of the ongoing maintenance work on the Caldon Canal.... The inside of a warm, steamy launderette did not appeal, even if we could find one that was open. The next nearest outdoor machine was 'beyond the tunnel', which had become an almost mythical place. My goodness, excitement was in the air!</p>

<p>A journey was afoot!</p>

<p>We booked our passage through the Harecastle Tunnel. So far so good. Now there was the small matter of Liberty Belle's intermittent horn and unreliable front light....both of which we needed to work on command for our pre-tunnel safety inspection.</p>

<p>These pieces of equipment had been deteriorating for some time and Tony had ordered new ones, delivered successfully to Mary, to be picked up at Christmas....You see what went wrong there.</p>

<p>Since then, despite Tony's efforts, the likelihood of them working when required had become a game of chance.</p>
 
<p>We wondered whether having a wife with a torch at the front of the boat, wired in to the horn mechanism and ready to scream at the appropriate moment, would be sufficient. The torch part of the plan seemed sensible enough for Tony to go out and buy a good quality one.</p>
 
<p>We travelled to the tunnel the day before our booking and moored there for the night. It is usually a quiet area with the occasional walker or cyclist passing by. On this occasion a couple of twits decided to wander about with an air-horn! Luckily they moved on before bedtime.</p>

<p>Topping up our water supply at the tap the next morning, the CRT chap, in charge of letting us into the tunnel, and, crucially, carrying out the safety check, arrived. Tony was testing Liberty Belle's horn. It was in a good mood this morning, having been protected from the rain for a few days in a plastic bag. We had a friendly chat, during which we confessed about the state of our equipment.</p>

<p>He was happy to relate that he had already heard the horn working and that the torch would suffice if the light failed, and suggested that we keep the internal boat lights on too. Something that we usually did anyway.</p>

<p>His bad news was that the CRT air-horn had been stolen overnight, an essential piece of safety equipment without which we were going nowhere! Oh heck. I gave him an account of the air-horn incident the evening before and an entirely useless 'description' of the lads.</p>

<p>A few phone calls and a short wait later, a CRT van arrived and a woman handed over half a dozen air-horns! Dressed in our life jackets and leather hats, we were ready and off we went.</p>

<p>Despite Tony scraping the top of his hat on an especially low part of the tunnel, and Liberty Belle leaving a little blue paint as a momento on the tunnel wall, we made it through in very good time. We really had arrived in the mythical land of Kidsgrove.</p>

<p>We turned onto the Macclesfield Canal and moored on the aqueduct over the Trent and Mersey Canal. We were close to Kidsgrove railway station, so that Tony could get to Birmingham for his first vaccine! Fabulous! We stayed there until we were in danger of running out of water, then moved the short distance to the next tap.</p>

<p>Thus, from facility to facility, we gradually made our way to the most convenient mooring space for the washing machine. We walked the mile or so uphill to the machines in a Londis car park on a traffic island in Congleton. Hurray!</p>

<p>To quote a man we met on the towpath, who, in better times, had journeyed around Europe with his family in a camper van, "Who needs LSD when you can get that excited over access to a washing machine?" I obviously look more worldly wise than I am!</p>

<p>Once the washing was done we had to then decide what our strategy would be for the rest of the lockdown. Going back to Westport Lake wouldn't be an essential journey and seemed a daft thing to do anyway, crowded as it was. We couldn't stay at a mooring near the washing machine as there were no other facilities near there. So, we decided we would continue forwards, one essential journey at a time.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I had the chance to book my first vaccine in Birmingham! This required an essential journey to Macclesfield, for the railway station. We were pleased to note that there were two taps marked there on our map. Perfect. Except that neither of the taps actually exist</p>

 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We stayed in Macclesfield until we needed water then headed for the tap in Poynton. Mooring nearby we stayed to explore the area, moving on again when we needed the boaters' facilities in the lovely Marple.</p>

<p>Marple is a delightful spot, with facilites and shops, (including a bakery where they sell dangerously excellent pastries), as well as beautiful surroundings and interesting walks.</p>

<p>We tried to eek out our coal supply but eventually we had to admit that we needed to find a boatyard or marina that would sell us some. So we turned onto the Peak Forest Canal and made our gradual way to the marina, which, it turned out, was only open three days a week. Of course we had arrived on the wrong day.</p>

<p>We continued to Bugsworth Basin and Whaley Bridge, at the end of the Peak Forest Canal, where we stayed until we were sure that the marina was open.</p>

<p>As well as a few bags of coal we also took the opportunity to replace an empty gas bottle and fill up on diesel. Topped up with everything, we made our way back to the facilities at Marple to await the hoped for 'great release' on the 12th April.</p>

<p>Footnotes:-</p>

<sup id="fn1">[1]</sup>
These stones lie on the 2 degrees West longitude. At local midday (13:08 BST, 12:08 GMT), the larger stone supposedly casts its shadow on one of the other standing stones. This, of course, assumes that the sun is out..

<h2>What Next?</h2>

<p>We hoped that we would be able to make our way back to Birmingham where we each have a vaccine appointment in May, 12 days apart. Whilst there we planned to collect a hire car and visit Mary, between appointments, (assuming Boris's plan for May 17th goes ahead) then bring her back to the boat for a holiday.</p>

<p>As usual there are now some obstacles in our way. Boats can no longer pass through Macclesfield. A culvert there is leaking and the canal has been drained to enable it to be repaired. The canal is not expected to reopen until the end of June. Circling around through Manchester and along the Bridgewater Canal to reach Birmingham has not been possible for months due to a blockage near the Anderton Boat Lift. We are expecting an email with an update on this situation on 20th April.</p>

<p>So, for now, we must leave Marple because the mooring restrictions have been reinstated, but we will travel along the Peak Forest Canal again. We will decide what to do when we have more information next week...</p>
