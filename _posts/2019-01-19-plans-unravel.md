<p>Once the complicated Christmas plan had been executed, Liberty Belle found herself in Banbury. We delayed our return (several times) finally settling on Friday 4th January.  We had a great deal to carry to the boat! As well as a rucksack each we had several new bookcases that Tony had made for the boat. He had dismantled them and bundled them up into two neat (but very heavy) parcels. The plan was that we would both walk to the station where I would stand guard over the rucksacks whilst Tony went back to collect the bookcases, balanced on his bike. Then I would add them to my pile whilst Tony returned the bike home then walked to join me. We would then do a similar relay back at the boat, assuming changing trains wouldn't be too difficult. When Joe came to collect our leftover groceries on the Thursday evening, he very kindly suggested that, as he was free that weekend, he could take everything to the boat for us and spend a bit of time on Liberty Belle. Fabulous! So, we loaded up his car with all the stuff we had intended to take.... plus a bit more!</p>

<p>Before we set off, travelling light, on Friday morning we had a call from Joe. His car had broken down on the way into work... Joe and his passenger were picked up by their boss and taken to the office. Tony cycled off to join the poor, overcrowded car and wait for the mechanic. The car was fixed, returned to Joe and Tony back home all before lunch, so we set off in the afternoon to try and get Liberty Belle cosy before Joe arrived later.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was uneventful apart from spotting a woman in very large curlers catching a train; a fellow passenger in our carriage wearing his dressing gown and a young child being spoon fed by his father with a pot noodle, encouraging him to eat it all up.....</p>

<p>Joe and the car-full of stuff arrived safe and sound, and the weekend began. We checked out Banbury shops, market and Tooley's boatyard before setting off for Cropredy. We were surprised to see a few other boats cruising along, as it had been so quiet on the canals before Christmas.</p>

<p>On our journey we met some very insistent swans who, spotting us sitting at the table in the boat came and tapped insistently on the window. In this manner they persuaded us to feed them...repeatedly!</p>

<p>We tried to give Joe the full Cropredy experience by taking him to see all the sights but failed to get a table in the cafe as it was full of cyclists. Oh well! Back at the boat we filled up with water, turned and travelled back to Banbury and Joe's car.</p>

<p>After Joe's departure we decided to stay in Banbury for a few days whilst we did a bit of shopping, some DIY and a bit more exploring before settling down to discuss the details of our plan to get to Newbury where the family was to meet up for Mum's birthday.</p>

<p>Oh dear.. We had been keeping a close eye on the winter closures on the Canal & River Trust website and planning our cruising accordingly. We knew that we couldn’t get beyond Newbury until 15th March when the locks there would re-open. We had dutifully bought our new license that enabled us to travel on the Thames but had failed to realise that the winter closures on the Thames were reported separately. We discovered a lock closure in Reading would prevent us from getting onto the Kennet and Avon canal until 15th March! Oh @#&£$ ! We didn't want to go onto the Thames unless we knew we could get off again, so we were stuck between Banbury and Oxford rather than the planned Newbury. Having contacted everyone it was decided to go ahead with the gathering in Newbury but there would be no boat there for people to gather at or, indeed, stay on. Sorry folks.</p>

<p>After much discussion, the new plan is to travel to Oxford then return to Banbury, leaving Liberty Belle there whilst we go to Newbury without her. Thus began the slow bicycle race to Oxford and back. We had a lock to do but first, more water. Whilst waiting for the water tank to fill up we met a lady who had lost her husband. She explained that he had dementia and it was becoming commonplace for her to lose him. She wanted to search further afield so we promised to keep an eye out for him and keep him there (outside the shopping centre) for her return. She described him (and their dog, who was keeping him company). To our huge relief, the wife, the husband and their dog all appeared before we had passed through the lock. Phew.
Onwards!</p>

<p>Travelling along the canal in winter the colours are mostly muted; the clouds of plummy reddish brown blackthorn hedges, orangey brown willow twigs and greyish white 'old man's beard' hanging onto the bare twigs of trees and shrubs. The sky comes in various shades of grey. The greens are the brightest;  from the huge bunches of deep, dark ivy to the almost yellow of some lichen and mosses. Standing at the back of Liberty Belle, chugging along, both of us engrossed in our own thoughts with the muted palette as our background we are suddenly animated by the spark of electric blue flashing at the edge of vision!</p>

<p>"Kingfisher!"</p>

<p>"I saw it!"</p>

<p>"It has landed, on that branch on the left...there!"</p>

<p>"It won't stay for a photo..." (fumbling with my gloves and reaching for the camera without daring to take my eyes off the bird....)</p>

<p>"Oh! There it goes!"</p>

<p>"Beautiful!"</p>

<p>We will never tire of them. We also love to see the heron, who is far more sedate but just as camera shy! Other wildlife we like to point out to each other are the red kites, buzzards and cormorants overhead. Recently we have seen some little grebes, another delight, but too busy diving to have their photos taken.</p>

<p>On our way to Thrupp (again) we stopped at -
Adderbury for a quick tour and a pint followed by a walk back in the dark;
Kirtlington for a look around the quarry before the heavens opened;
Clifton for an unplanned country walk to the village of Deddington, arriving back in the dark.</p>




<p>A lunchtime walk around Kirtlington's old quarry which is now a nature reserve with mizmaze.

<p>We went to see what the village of Clifton had to offer and discovered a sign for the Deddington  Circular Walk. On a whim we decided to follow it, taking a diversion to see the Deddington Castle (site of). As time went on we became increasingly concerned about completing the walk in daylight.... a gentle stroll became a power walk! Seven miles later we found ourselves walking along the road in the dark with Tony shining his phone app torch at oncoming cars...</p
