<p>So, there we were in Keadby Lock, with adrenalin still in our veins! We had survived our last turn off the River Trent.
Keadby Lock has a swing bridge just beyond it, which magically opened as we emerged from the lock.</p>

<p>We were now on the Stainforth & Keadby Canal, which is only 14 miles long and connects the River Trent to the River Don (of Doncaster fame). It is deep and wide and, because the land around is flat, it has only two other locks, Thorne and Bramwith.</p>

<p>It does, however, have several swing bridges, the first of which was a railway crossing, which we knew had been having technical problems for some considerable time. It was now available for use but had to be worked by an engineer. The Keadby lock keeper had contacted him to arrange this for us.</p>

<p>As we approached a train was crossing, but then it too, magically opened.</p>

</figure>

<p>Further along we came to a road which crossed the canal on an electric swing bridge then immediately crossed the railway line running alongside the canal. There were road barriers for both crossings, one set operated when a boat crew begins to swing the road bridge, the other set operated by a man in a tower between the canal and railway line. It took me a minute or two to take in the situation and find the console containing the operating buttons.</p>

<p>The first thing that needs to be done at one of these consoles is to locate the keyhole for the  "British Waterways Key" as it is still known. Then, enter the key and turn until the OPEN and CLOSE buttons are illuminated, before checking for traffic and operating the bridge. This is normally a simple operation but not so here. I fiddled with the key but the buttons refused to illuminate. Of course this made me wonder whether it had anything to do with the railway crossing. It looked as if they were completely independent but it also seemed to me that this could potentially cause mayhem.</p>

<p>What if a line of cars were waiting beyond the railway line and, after the train passed, the barriers were lifted, just as I, at the same moment, decided to close the barriers across the canal?
Would the cars start forward and have to immediately back off again, reversing in graceful unison back beyond the railway track?
Maybe they were connected after all.</p>

<p>Just as all this was going through my head a kind man emerged from the tower and explained that the keyhole was a nuisance to everyone. The key needed to be turned just enough and no more. I followed his instructions and everything went smoothly from then on.
Apparently there is someone on duty in the tower at all times, day and night. I wonder if they get bored waiting for someone to want to cross the track or their days are full of chaos and mayhem...</p>

<p>Next I had Thorne's Princess Royal pedestrian swing bridge to deal with. Usually these are quicker than road bridges in a town because people don't mind being stopped, in fact they are interested and pleased to be allowed to help. On this occasion there was nobody waiting so I could operate the bridge immediately without delaying anyone.</p>

<p>The instructions mentioned barriers; I couldn't immediately see them because they looked like a continuation of the side railings, but then I noticed hinges. I made sure I was on the same side of each set of barriers as the operating console before shutting them, as there was very little room to get around them if I was on the wrong side. So far, so sensible. Then, with a flourish, I pressed the OPEN button but nothing happened. I then stopped to read the instructions properly. There was a warning that the bridge would not operate unless the barriers closed fully, with an audible click. Had I heard a click? Possibly not...</p>

<p>Oh well, I would just swing them open and shut again, careful to hear a click. Oh no, that would be too simple. The barriers at my end were firmly shut, without a gap big enough for me to squeeze through....it must be those at the other end that needed re-doing. There was no-one about at the other end to help me.</p>

<p>Then I logically thought, I would just have to start again by pressing the CLOSE button. That should surely reset everything. No.</p>

<p>From his position on Liberty Belle, Tony, wondering why it was taking so long, noticed me frantically trying to push my sturdy little self through the narrow gap and came to see what was happening. It pains me to say it, but he managed to squeeze himself through and was able to re-shut the barrier with a satisfying click. Well done, Mr. Slim!</p>

<p>I shan't be able to think of Princess Anne without being reminded of this bridge. I suppose, because Her Royal Self could easily squeeze through in an emergency, she thought the rest of us could too. Not so, Ma'am, not so!</p>

<p>Just beyond the swing bridge was a boatyard where Tony hoped to top up our diesel tank. The pump was obscured by boats so we thought we might not bother, but Tony went on foot to investigate, while I held on to Liberty Belle. Tony was shown where we could moor, near the pump, and we filled up - it seemed that we had even less fuel than we realised, so it was a good job he had persevered.</p>

<p>Onwards. Thorne Lock and swing bridge were opened for us by a lock keeper with a remote control, amazing!
At the next swing bridge the crew of a community trip boat was already operating it and they let us through. That was kind. Maybe things were going to be simpler from now on...</p>

<p>Hmmmm. I then managed to drop my favourite, light weight windlass into Bramwith Lock. Tony tried for quite some time to retrieve it using our fishing magnet but with no luck. The lock was very deep and no doubt had a substantial layer of silt at the bottom. The windlass, although aluminium, had a jubilee clip attached to it for just such an occasion but it was small, and the magnet didn't find it. Bother!</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the lock we reached the end of the Stainforth & Keadby and swept left onto the Sheffield & South Yorkshire. For a deep, straight, wide canal with only one lock for me to operate, the S&K had given us an eventful couple of days!</p>

<p>The next main event was Barnby Dun's electric lift bridge. Despite having a tower from which a keeper could operate the bridge, it has a console at the side of the road from which the boat crew operate it. Golly there was a lot of traffic, so I carefully picked my moment but we still managed to cause quite a tailback. Just beyond the bridge was some mooring, so we pulled in, tied up and had a little look around. We found a smart new Co-op where we bought a few groceries and the Church of St Peter & St Paul to explore.</p>

<p>Our next mooring was at Sprotborough but we visited Doncaster on the way, for a lunch stop. We had a little look around the minster but what really caught our eye was the fundraising fete in the grounds. Refreshments and a stall selling home made cakes, jams and pickles. Perfect.</p>

<p>You would think that having lost my nice, light windlass I would be extra careful from now on. However, I managed to leave something behind at Mexborough Lock.</p>

<p>When travelling uphill in wide locks, Tony will pass the end of the centre rope to me so that I can use it to pull Liberty Belle close to the side of the lock and either wrap it around a bollard and pass it back to Tony, or give him a chance to climb out of the lock and hold onto the rope from the side. This is necessary to stop Liberty Belle thrashing around in the lock as it is being filled.</p>

<p>When the locks are very deep, it can be difficult for us to pass the rope between us, so we added a large brass ring to one end of a chain and a small wooden handle to the other. I can put this neatly in my pocket, then hold the wooden handle and lower the large ring on the chain, Tony can pass the end of the rope through the ring and I can easily lift it up. In order to pull the rope tight I need to let go of the chain which inevitably falls to the ground. I then have to remember to pick it up and put it back in my pocket....</p>

<p>I didn't realise until we reached the next lock, where we tied up and walked back. It was just where I had left it.</p>

<p>The following day was Monday and we were due to travel through the Tinsley Lock Flight to Sheffield. Tony had used the central booking system to arrange this on Friday, as instructed. They assured him that he would receive a phone call from the lock keeper to confirm the booking. We had received no such call. Unfortunately we couldn't call back the central booking line because their phones are not manned over the weekend.</p>

<p>At 9 a.m. on Monday morning, as soon as the office opened again, Tony contacted them. He was assured that an email had been sent to the Tinsley lock keeper but he would be contacted now by phone and Tony would get a call back.</p>

<p>Dave, the lock keeper, rang straight away, explained that he hadn't received the email but said he would remove the padlocks and the locks would be ready for us by the time we arrived.</p>

<p>Dave was as good as his word and more. Each lock we came to was set in our favour with a gate left open for us. The poor man was on his own, not having had a chance to organise a team of volunteers to help him, flitting from lock to lock on his bike.</p>

<p>In this way we made good time, being careful not to catch Liberty Belle on the overhanging walkways, (she is a bit long for comfort in these locks). Thanks Dave.</p>

<p>When we finally caught Dave up, he described the central booking system as "a bag of marbles that we do our best with."</p>

<p>We arrived in Sheffield's Victoria Quay and moored.</p>

<p>The following day we explored Sheffield: the Cathedral, Peace Gardens, Winter Gardens (for a coffee), Botanical Gardens (for a lie down in the shade) and a general look around the town. We like Sheffield. It's proud of its history, the buildings look well cared for, the streets are clean and tidy with plenty of space for pedestrians and there seem to be pleasant public spaces at every turn.</p>

<p>The Winter Gardens have little winding paths around the plants with information boards describing the building itself and the planting. Dotted around are items for children to spot and plenty of places to sit. The adjoining Millennium Galleries were closed when we were there but, peaking through the glass doors, I would say it looks well worth a visit.</p>

<p>After exploring Sheffield we returned to Liberty Belle ready to  turn her around at the end of the navigation to face back the way we had come. It was going to be an early-ish start the next morning, so we didn't want any complications.</p>

<p>Just before the winding hole there is a swing bridge across the canal. The mechanism for the bridge is operated, as some are, using a windlass. This one is unusual though because the operator stands on the bridge whilst moving it. It feels very strange and takes quite a long time....when I began there was no-one waiting to cross but by the time it was open, there was quite a gathering.</p>

<p>People hoping to cross the bridge had to wait for Liberty Belle to pass by, turn, and then pass by again before I closed the bridge. Once it was over and I was walking back to the boat I fell into conversation with another boater who turned out to be the duty lock keeper booked to take us down the locks in the morning. In this case, she had been given advance warning and two volunteers would be helping her.</p>

</figure>

<p>We set off at 8 in the morning to meet the lock keeper and her team at the top lock at 9, as arranged. The weather was good, the team was efficient and the whole process went very smoothly.</p>

<p>We headed back along the Sheffield & South Yorkshire Canal. watching kingfishers on the way. We stalled briefly when we reached Kilnhurst flood lock.</p>

<p>Despite both sets of gates standing wide open, the red light  was on, indicating that we should not pass through. We tied up and puzzled over it, speculating on the possible reasons for this. There was no sign of anyone at or near the lock, nor any notices of explanation. Maybe a large commercial boat is due through....we certainly don't want to meets something like that head-on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tony managed to get through to the CRT on his phone. Apparently it was a mistake and the light should be green. Ok....off we went.</p>

<p>We were travelling back along the way we had come, but on arriving at the end of the Sheffield & South Yorkshire Canal we didn't turn back towards Keadby but joined the New Junction instead. This short stretch of canal, which opened in 1905, connects Sheffield to the Aire & Calder Canal.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the New Junction is the aqueduct that carries it over the River Don. It has a guillotine gate at each end which are only lowered when the river is in flood and the water is in danger of becoming higher than the canal above. The gates then prevent the flood water from escaping along the canal to the nearby low lying land. What a scary thought!</p>

 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The next interesting feature was Sykehouse Lock. It is the only one on this canal.</p>

<p>When Tony had been planning this stretch of the journey, the Sykehouse Lock and the section of the New Junction canal beyond had been closed for months. However, we had set off anyway in the hope that it would be open by the time we got there.... Luckily for us they decided to open it up once a day for bookings.</p>

<p>There were several of us booked to go through and, as soon as the lock light turned from red to green, we all moved forward.
As we all entered it became clear that there were very few places to tie the boats.</p>

<p>The lock keeper remained in his tower and gave no assistance whatsoever. We all muddled through by looping rope through or around whatever we could find, including each others boats. He then proceded to let the water in far too fast, causing us all to swish about in the lock. I was quite afraid that Liberty Belle would smack too hard into the plastic boat in front of us. We all exchanged despairing glances but the lock keeper managed not to catch anyone's eye.. It was all quite stressful but we all came out unscathed.</p>

<p>In a convoy we all turned onto the Aire & Calder Canal, then arrived at Pollington Lock. We were pleased to see that the lock keeper had left his tower to greet us. He waved everyone in and people tied up their boats. When it came to our turn there wasn't a long enough space left for us.</p>

<p>The helpful lock keeper indicated a position behind one of the boats and told us there was enough room there. It was clear to Tony that this wasn't the case. The other boaters appeared to agree as they took the initiative and shuffled their boats a bit until we were able to position Liberty Belle in the centre of the lock and tie up alongside another narrowboat. It was unconventional but it worked. At last we were all in and the lock was operated.</p>

<p>On leaving the lock, we had decided to moor up for lunch. We pulled over but the bollards were too far apart for our ropes, so we had to abandon the idea. Pulling back out into the canal was tricky because the wind was strong and against us. With some difficulty we managed it and trailed behind at the back of the convoy.</p>

<p>The rest of the Aire & Calder was uneventful and we passed through the next two locks and turned onto the River Aire, through Beale Lock and headed for the sharp left turn through a flood lock. Having been told by a local boater that he had never seen this lock closed, we fully expected to go straight through but we couldn't confirm that for ourselves until we turned directly into it. This was a bit unnerving so we stopped briefly at the pontoon just before the turn for me to get off....just in case it was closed.</p>

<p>Tony left me and turned the corner, only to be met by a pair of huge gates. In the wind and rain he managed to manipulate Liberty Belle and persuade her back to the pontoon. Meanwhile in the same weather conditions, I was faced with unfamiliar locking gear, trying to ascertain which paddles were up and which were down, altering them (counting how many turns of the windlass each one took) to enable me to open the gates and hoping I remembered their positions correctly so that I could leave the lock as I had found it. We got through and I think all was well...</p>

<p>Suddenly the rain stopped and we found ourselves on the calm and sedate Selby Canal. All tension now gone we travelled to Selby and moored outside the lock that would take us, at 7:30 the next morning, onto the River Ouse where we would be heading North to York and Ripon!</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>Sorry this has taken sooooo long to send to you.</p>

<p>We have been very busy, finishing our journey as quickly as we could before winter set in and moving back into the house.
After 3 years and 2 months, Liberty Belle is back with the brokers and up for sale, waiting for her next adventure.</p>

<p>I will continue to send newsletters until you have caught up with our adventures.</p>
