<p class="itinery">From: Crick To: Coventry.</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Norton, Weedon, Rugby and Hawkesbury Junction.</p>

<p>We picked the boat up in the last week of August. We hired a van to carry all out things to the boat at Crick. We set off through Crick Tunnel with plans for Tony to walk back so that he could return the hire van to Eastleigh. We had our first problem in that the Watford locks were closed when we reached them so had to moor up nearby. Tony travelled home while Rachel discovered our next problem. We had run out of water! Fortunately there were toilet facilities at the top of Watford locks.</p>

<p>Tony returned the next day by train and after a cold and uncomfortable night in our bed we set off.</p>

<p>We had our first near disaster as we caught the boat on a lock cill at Norton. We rescued the boat just in time in front of an audience of pub frequenters nearby.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty were volunteering at a nearby music festival and wanted to meet up. We worked out that Norton Junction would be a good place to meet up with relatively good access to a railway station for Joe to return to after our cruise.</p>

<p>We had a little bit of time so we travelled the few miles to Weedon, where we went out for a lovely curry, Weedon Bec and back.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty joined us for a couple of days.</p>

<p>We did Braunston Tunnel for the first time and then moved on to Rugby where Joe and Kirsty left us. Tony ordered a new mattress to replace the very uncomfortable one on the boat hoping that its delivery would coincide with his visit home to take Tarka to the vet for more tablets.</p>

<p>We then cruised on to Coventry with a plan to meet up with Robin there.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Coventry To: Lowsonford</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Birmingham, Stratford on Avon.</p>

<p class="itinery">Robin and Ben - From: Coventry To: Coventry Via: Nuneaton and Hawkesbury junction.</p>

<p>Robin came to visit for the wekend bringing our new mattress. We explored the city a bit and visited 'The Greyhound' pub at Hawkesbury junction.</p>

<p>Tony went home with Robin, mostly to visit the vet to get more pills for Tarka but stayed for a few days doing jobs.</p>

<p>Rachel was using the free Wi-Fi in IKEA and Wetherspoons to publish her newsletters. Tony and Tarka travelled back on the train. After a visit to the excellent Coventry Transport Museum we travelled to Bristol by train for a weekend with Cathy, Will, John and Melissa.</p>

<p>While we were in Bristol, Robin and Ben borrowed the boat, had Liberty Belle's first breakdown after travelling just a few hundred yards, and cruised from Coventry to Nuneaton and back.</p>

<p>We had made arrangements to collect Mary for a cruise starting in Birmimgham so we made our way there via Atherstone, Polesworth,  Fazeley Junction, Tamworth and Salford Junction.</p>

<p>In Birmingham we moored outside the O2 Arena which was lovely but noisey at night with drunken revellers breaking glass on the towpath. We met up with Julia for curry at her favourite Indian restaurant, Itihaas, and discovered Damascena, a Middle Eastern coffee shop and cafe.</p>

<p>Mary arrived by train and with her on board we cruised to Stratford upon Avon, getting wedged in a narrow lock and, by chance, deciding to go to the 'Fleur de Lys' pub in Lowsonford where Julia, knowing the pub well, joined us for lunch.</p>

<p>We did some sight-seeing in Wooten Wawen and Wilmecote visiting the very interesting and informative Mary Arden's House and Tudor Farm where Mary and Tony had a go at goose herding!</p>

<p>While moored in Stratford on Avon Tony had an accident and lost his glasses in the water by the pontoon but these were recovered using a fishing landing net purchased at Argos!</p>

<p>We explored all the Shakespeare tourist attractions and Joe and Kirsty joined us for the weekend and celebrated Rachel's birthday wth a family breakfast.</p>

<p>We cruised back towards Leamington Spa, where Mary was due to go home from, stopping for lunch again at the 'Fleur de Lys' pub in Lowsonford.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Lowsonford To: Braunston</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Warwick, Leamington Spa, Braunston, Northampton and back.</p>

<p>We completed our journey from Stratford upon Avon to Leamington Spa.</p>

<p>We joined the Grand Union Canal at Kingswood junction and headed for Warwick down the Hatton flight of locks. We had a short explore in Warwick and moved on to Lemingon Spa the next day.</p>

<p>We went home on the train from Leamington with Mary but had to get off at the next station as Mary's ticket was not valid for that train.</p>

<p>On our return to the boat at Leamington we travelled on and visited Radford Semele and Long Itchington, which Tony particularly liked. It had a lot of pubs, a village pond and a nice busy feel to it.</p>

<p>While moored tony installed some USB sockets on the boat in place of the 12V cigarette socket under the TV as the weather was poor.</p>

<p>When we first got the boat, we had ordered a sofa bed and needed to collect it once it was delivered to our house. We wanted to be reasonably close to home for this as Tony would have to bring the sofa bed to the boat in a hire van and then drive back home the same day to drop off the van. We thought that Norton Junction might be a good place to do this as it is familiar to us, has good road access and a relatively close railway station. but it was too soon to go there just yet.</p>

<p>So on our return from home we decided to cruise to Northampton and back to kill some time.</p>

<p>We cruised to Braunston where we had to moor up in a private spot as it was getting dark. We moved on a little the next morning and then stayed for a couple of days and visited the 'Admiral Nelson' which had a nice feel to it.<p>

<p>While here Tony booked an appointment to have solar panels installed by Tim from Onboard Solar. We will have to make sure we are moored somewhere that has road access when he comes to install them in November.</p>

<p> We moved on through Braunston Tunnel and to Norton Junction and Lower Heyford where we became celebrities at a film screening in the village hall. From there we continued to Northampton stopping at Bugbrooke for a look round.</p>

<p>We explored Northampton for a few days and were the only boat moored there for most of the time. Tony took the opportunity to fit an extra shelf in the TV cupboard and boot cupboard at the rear of the boat.</p>

<p>We had help on our way back to Gayton Junction from Leon, one of two homeless men who had tents by the canal. His friend was called Ian. Leon was very enthusiastic and got us through the locks very quickly.</p>

<p>Back in the summer Tony had ordered some new garage doors so we knew we had to get back to the house to take delivery and fit them. While travelling Tony had a phone call explaining that one of the workers had fallen off a lorry and injured himself so the delivery would be delayed.</p>

<p>So now, we have to plan for our Sofa Bed delivery, the solar panel fitting and the garage door delivery. We need to be in suitable places, sometimes needing access to a railway station, sometmes needing access to a road!</p>

<p>On our way moving slowly back to Norton where we are hoping for the sofa bed delivery we stopped to look round Brockhall. We had touble getting information about when our sofa would be delivered so decided to move on as we needed to get through a lock closing at Napton.</p>

<p>We made our way to Braunston where we had our first really cold morning with icicles on the inside of the windows.</p>

<p>We had also made a plan on for Joe and Kirsty to have the boat on the Llanollen Canal over Christmas as we thought this would be a nice place to be.</p>

<p>The logistics were getting very complicated!</p>


<h2>November 2018</h2>

<p class="itinery">From: Braunston To: Banbury</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Napton and Cropredy.</p>

<p>This was a month of complicated logistics so we could not relax.</p>

<p>We moved on from Braunston and stopped at Lower Shuckburgh which looked like a good place to stop for walks when we have time. While here Tony phoned up about the sofa bed. After some delaying and phoning back we were told that the sofa had been delivered to the Southampton store and then lost! It was eventually found and a delivery arranged for the following week. At last a little bit of certainty - we have dates for the sofa bed, the garage doors and the solar panel installation!</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty wanted to use the boat while we were away from it at Christmas and we had hoped to let them have it on the Llangollen  canal - very pretty and with the advantage of decent towns with pubs and restaurants. But we had checked on the winter closures and discovered that we could not get through Birmingham for several months.</p>
 
<p>So, our plans had to change. They could have the boat at Oxford and we could pick up the sofa bed somewhere on the way.</p>

<p>One of the locks at Napton was due to close for repair so we had to travel fairly quickly to get there before it closed. We would be confined to the Oxford Canal for the winter but when we got our license for the River Thames in January we could go down the Thames on our way to visit Cathy in Bristol.</p>

<p>We managed to get to Napton before the lock closure where we discovered the lovely pub 'The Folly'. It was full when we arrived but more and more people arrived and they were all accommodated. We then moved on to Marston Doles where Tony returned to the house by bus and train and delivered the sofa bed to the boat by hire van. After returning the van at Eastleigh Tony travelled back on the train and bus.</p>

<p>We decided that Cropredy would be a good place to have the solar panels installed so cruised on to there stopping at Fenny Compton where we took part in the 100 year anniversary of the end of the First World War and explored the village of Wormleighton.</p>

<p>Cropredy was a lovely little village with a nice pub the 'Brasenose Arms'. We saw some very obvious ridge and furrow field systems on our way and we have become accustomed to seeing these in the fields in this area.</p>

<p>Our new solar panels were installed but we are puzzling over why the voltages in the cabin are lower than the voltages measured by the solar panel meter (tim-o-meter).</p>

<p>Then we moved on to Banbury where another closure was due. We spent a few days exploring Banbury which we both liked. It has a nice mix of modern shops, old streets with smaller shops and a few interesting buildings.</p>

<p>We went home from Banbury to receive and fit the garage doors and sadly Tarka became ill and was put down while we were at home.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Banbury To: Thrupp</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Kings Sutton, Aynho, Lower Heyford, Kirtlington, Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxford and back.</p>

<p class="itinery">Joe and Kirsty - From: Thrupp To: Banbury.</p>

<p>So, now we have dealt with the sofa bed delivery, the new garage doors and the solar panel installation! We only needed to find somewhere for Joe and Kirsty to pick up the boat at Christmas. So we cruised towards Oxford stopping at various places on the way.</p>

<p>King's Sutton, with its tall church spire, is visible for miles around and because of the winding of the canal apparently in different direction each time you see it.</p>

<p>While we were at home Rachel had made a curtain to be hooked up at the back of the bedroom to reduce the draughts which come through the many vents on the boat and Tony had made wooden brackets for it. We tried it out but it will need some modifications before it fits properly.</p>

<p>We have had problems with condensation forming under the bed's mattress so each day we lift the mattress and prop it up to be aired. While in Banbury Tony bought some wood and while moored in King's Sutton he made a slatted base to the bed to replace the solid MDF ones. This allows the mattress to air each day without having to lift it each day and is a major improvement to our day to day life!</p>

<p>The solar panels still didn't seem to be charging the batteries as expected and the fridge was refusing to run properly. Tony decided to try to get an engineer to look the wiring to see what was wrong and hoped to get the boat serviced as it was well overdue and he didn't know how to do it himself. However the boatyard at Aynho had no slots available this side of Christmas.</p>

<p>Tony eventually diagnosed that the panels had been wired to charge the starter battery rather than the domestic batteries. Tim had assumed that the three batteries located next to each other were the three domestic batteries and that the seperate one was the starter battery. But, in fact, it looks like previous owners added an extra domestic battery at some point and added that one at the end rather than locating it with the others.</p>

<p>Emailed photos to Tim, who spends his winters in India, confirmed Tony's diagnosis and he was able to reconnect the solar panel circuit to the correct battery.</p>

<p>We had our first breakdown, which was the same problem that Robin had experienced. One of the engine cooling hoses is a bit too short and therefore under tension so engine vibrations eventually cause the pipe  to pop off the end. Tony started periodically checking that the pipe was secure and the treat of another breakdown was a constant 'worry'.</p> 

<p>On our way to Oxford we explored Upper and Lower Heyford, Kirtlington and stopped one evening as it was getting dark, precariously on a slight bend at Shipton-on-Cherwell.</p>

<p>The next day we reached Thrupp, a lovely location! It is a tiny village with two pubs and a lovely basin where the canal turns next to a lift bridge. We thought this might be a good place for Joe and Kirsty to start their Christmas cruise. The very friendly warden also said that there is parking available for when Joe comes at Christmas and that if that is full he can park in the warden parking area.</p>
<p>We carried on towards Oxford until we reached Dukes Lock. However there was a warning at the lock that the only winding point beyond is the River Thames and we were unsure if we would be allowed to use the river without a license. So we turned round at the junction with some difficulty in the increasing wind.</p>

<p>After a short stay we moved back to Thrupp and moored up for Joe and Kirsty to find at Christmas. We also booked a Christmas Day meal in the 'Jolly Boatman' having investigated possibilities there and at the 'Boat Inn' in the village.</p>

<p>Our fridge is still not working properly. Tony investigated and with the help of the internet discovered that the wiring to the fridge is probably undersized.</p>

<p>We went home from Thrupp by bus and train and spent a few days over Christmas with Cathy and Will with Mary in Bristol. We also met Will's mum there. </p>

<p>Meawhile plans had been made for a family meet up in Newbury for Mary's 80th birthday and a table in a pub was booked. Once we get our Gold license in January we will travel down the River Thames onto the Kennet and Avon canal and have everyone on board for tea and cake, which Mary has baked, after the pub lunch.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Banbury To: Banbury</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Cropredy, Oxford, Thrupp, Oxford and back again.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty had left the boat in Banbury and while at home Tony had made some bookcases from some oak faced MDF and had parcelled them up ready to take back to the boat on the train. Then Joe decided to come up for the weekend and despite his car breaking down Tony was able to wait for the breakdown man to come and fix it while Joe was at work. So Joe was able to bring all our heavy bits in the car after we had returned to the boat on the train.<p>

<p>While Joe was on board we cruised to Cropredy and back and had a meal in the 'Brasenose Arms'.</p>

<p>We were pleased when Tony installed the bookcases because rather than making the boat look bitty they make it look better with bookcases all along the wall.</p>

<p>Also while at home Tony printed off a map of the canal network for Rachel to use a a pattern for an embroidered map which she plans to make of our route.</p>

<p>We discovered a flaw in our plan to travel down the Thames and onto the Kennet and Avon Canal. It had not occurred to us that the closures on the River would be reported seperately from the canal closures and we discovered that a lock on the Thames was closed. So we had to abandon our plan for a family gathering for Mary's birthday on the boat in Newbury.</p>

<p>We explored Banbury for several days, visiting the aviary and doing a few short walks. Tony also booked a couple of Boat and Engine mantenance courses from the River Canal Rescue organisation.</p>

<p>We still needed to travel to Newbury in February for Mary's birthday meal, so we decided to travel to Oxford again with a little more time to stop off on the way. Oxford would be a convenient place to travel home</p>

<p>We stopped at Adderbury, a lovely place with lovely collections of houses nestled together and a small area with lakes to walk around.</p>

<p>Then off to Aynho. From there we walked into Clifton and followed the Deddington Circular Walk. While on this walk Cathy phoned to see if she could come to visit.</p>

<p>Next we stopped at Kirtlington and had time to explore the quarry. We ended up stopping at Thrupp again to await Cathy and Will's visit.</p>

<p>While waiting we had an unexpected visit from Robin so we visited both pubs for lunch and beer.</p>

<p>With Cathy and Will on board we cruised to Oxford and back over a couple of days. We ventured onto the River Thames briefly and did a small loop. When we got back to Thrupp we had a snow storm but we managed to walk to Annie's Tea room for tea and cake!</p>

<p>From Thrupp we walked into Kidlington across the fields. When we left Thrupp the canal was frozen and we went ice-breaking. Rachel attempting to push me off was the first indication that steering would be tricky in the ice. Turning to moor for water was also tricky. The boat doesn't want to go sideways due to the push-back from the ice. The water point was frozen but we managed to defrost it with water from the warm tap using the dog bowl provided! We carried on often having to steer the boat in a zig zag to break the ice while maintaining control. Watching the huge sheets of broken ice, sometimes 20 feet across shimmering as they broke and vibrated was lovely. Overall it was a little stressful with the worry of hitting moored boats but it was all ok in the end. We moored up just before Pigeon Lock at Kirtlington.</p>

<p>While there we had a walk into Tackley, a lovely path sometimes near the River Cherwell which had a lovely community shop.</p>

<p>We moved on to Aynho Wharf stopping to visit Somerton church - the one with the tall spire. From there we did the Deddington Circular Walk again and had a bizarre experience trying to get a cuppa in the Deddington Hotel.</p>

<p>We decided to try to get to Banbury where we need to be to collect a hire car so we can travel home. The weather forecast for the next few days includes wind and ice and we don't want to cruise in thick ice.</p>

<p>As we were there earlier than expected we were able to do the Banbury Fringe Walk which is about 10 miles.</p>

<p>Finally we collected our hire car and travelled home.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Banbury To: Kilby Bridge</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Cropredy and back twice, Napton, Braunston, Crick, Yelvertoft, Foxton Locks, Welford and Market Harborough.</p>

<p>After our family gathering in Newbury for Mary's birthday we returned to the boat in our hire car.</p>

<p>While at home Tony had bought a small printer hoping to use it on the boat to print out maps for walking.</p>

<p>We set off into central Banbury and Tony booked a man to service our fire extinguishers. We had to stay a few days until he came and stayed a few days after as Tony had to attend his Engine Servicing classroom course in Stafford. We went by train and stayed overnight in a Travelodge there.</p>

<p>While we were waiting in Banbury Tony installed some USB sockets above the dinette and in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Tony had problems buying filters for the engine. Ones that claimed to be compatible with the current ones were not.</p>

<p>We had two sets of visitors planning to visit us in Cropredy so we set off for there. First we had Ildi, Tom and Esther followed the next day by Chetna, Dipak, Prem and Viraj. We cruised a few miles North and back with each of our visitors.</p>

<p>We had decided that as the River Thames was not yet an option we needed to find somewhere else to go. We discovered that we could go to Nottingham! So after our visitors had left we moved on stopping at Claydon and Priors Hardwick where we had walks.</p>

<p>Due to a misunderstanding we thought we might be able to meet up with Garry and Helen in Bath when they visit Molly in Bath at Easter and we wanted to have Mary on board to visit Cathy in Bristol so we did some planning. We decided we should be able to do this after Nottingham. We also decided that we should go to Higher Moor in June from Leamington Spa rather than Yorkshire as this seemed more achievable. Once we had done our planning we realised our misunderstanding!</p>

<p>At Napton we again visited the 'Folly Inn' where we met a lovely Border Terrier puppy called Rex, reminiscent of Tarka when she was that age. Full of life and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>We moved on to Braunston where Robin joined us for the weekend. He accompanied us through Watford locks, where it was nice to see lambs in the field, and he went home from there. We passed through Crick almost exactly 6 months since we picked up Liberty Belle at the start of our adventures.</p>

<p>We stopped at Yelvertoft where we visited the deli called Squisito where we saw a sausage making lesson in progress and then mooored in Welford at the end of the arm. We had a bit of a mishap in Husbands Bosworth Tunnel where Tony misjudged the distance to an oncoming boat which did not move over enough and we scratched some paintwork and woodwork.</p>

<p>The weather was lovely as we cruise to Foxton Locks. So lovely that we had record temperatures for winter and an ice cream! We carried on to Market Harborough where we spent a day exploring the museum and library, with its corset exhibition, and set off in the evening for Debdale.</p>

<p>Robin tracked us down for a lunchtime cuppa at Newton Harcourt, after a job in Nottingham. Despite Newton Harcourt being an alleged beauty spot we could find nothing much to see so we set off again to do the remaining 7 locks to Kilby Bridge morring opposite the slightly unsightly wharf.</p>

<p class="itinery">From:Kilby Bridge To: Banbury</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Leicester, Birstall and Mount Sorrel, Loughborough and back to Norton Junction.</p>

<p>We quickly made it to Leicester and moored at the secure moorings at Castle Gardens. We spent three night there and explored the town. We saw a free drama performance celebrating a local suffragette. We also visited the cathderal, the Richard III museum, for which we had free tickets, the Old Guildhall and an outside viewing of the Jewry Wall.</p>

<p>From there we visited Birstall and Mount Sorrel, which had a nice view from the non existent 'castle' and then to Loughborough.</p>

<p>We spurned the basin as it was dark and unappealing and moored by the T-junction. We explored the Carnegie Library and the Aviary and visited the museum which had nice exhibits of the stocking making industry and Ladybird Books which apparently come from here. Rachel particularly liked the stone sculpture of a seated man with an extended stockinged leg.</p>

<p>Within a couple of days we were informed that the River Trent was in flood so we could not go forward to Nottingham. We decided to wait around for a while for it to reopen. We had hoped to go on the River Trent to Birmingham after visiting Nottingham but discovered that one of the locks on the River Trent is closed for another fortnight and we didn't want to stay that long as we need to get to Bristol. But then the river Soar behind us came into flood and was closed.</p>

<p>We were trapped between two stretches of river in flood.</p>

<p>We took our opportunity to do some walks and visited Nottingham by train.</p>

<p>It had been windy since leaving Leicester so we decided to move into the basin as it would be more convenient if we are stuck in Loughborough for a long time.</p>

<p>While here Tony improved the perspex hatch cover. It had been just an inconvenient floppy piece of perspex. It now had an aluminium frame round it. He also bought a folding glass shower screen and was able to modify it by removing one of the four panels so that it fits our shower. This is much nicer than the plastic curtain we had had up to now.</p>

<p>While trapped in Loughborough we made a lot of use of the two Wetherspoon pubs as it was cold and we had a limited supply of coal. It was also lovely to see a man walking his pet ferret on a lead. Apparently the ferret nags his owner each day to go out! Tony also heard from the River Canal Rescue people with a a date for his course where they send and engineer to service your boat with you. Tony had been trying to organise this since the classroom course and was just about to give up on it and get his money back.</p>

<p>After almost two weeks the River Soar opened and we set off south again trying to get back to the River Thames as soon as possible as we had plans to go to Bristol as soon as the lock on the Thames was open.</p>

<p>On our way we had a request from Joe to meet up to do some work converting his new van to a camper van. We made our way quickly, in three days, to Norton Junction as we knew where he could park and work on the van. On our way we encountered an American family on a hire boat in one of the Foxton locks. One member of the family had lost his phone in the lock!</p>

<p>We had a busy, sunny weekend with Joe, working on his van. We managed to fit the electrics in his van. After the weekend we moved on stopping in Braunston, Napton and Claydon. We got to Banbury early enough to go home a day earlier than planned. We decided to go home as we have some time to kill in Banbury before Tony's enginge servicing course.</p>

<p>Much of our time at home was spent working on Joe's van as he wanted it to be ready for an Easter trip to Scotland and the Lake District.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Banbury To: Bath</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Oxford, The River Thames, Reading, Bath and Bristol.</p>

<p>After some time spent at home we returned to the boat at Banbury and Tony had his course servicing the boat with an engineer from the River Canal Rescue organisation. We set off with plans to go on the River Thames to the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bristol. We managed to get to Aynho that day.</p>

<p>A little while after setting off the next day we came across Neil walking the towpath and he brought cake! That evening we stopped at Thrupp and travelled to Jerico in central Oxford the next day.</p>

<p>We were joined by Robin and Julie for the weekend and Neil popped in for the evening on his way home. The next day we joined the Thames and spent the weekend travelling down the river to the Kennet and Avon. Robin and Julie left and we had a traumatic evening going through Reading until we reached the safety of the navigation and a restful evening.<p>

<p>We moored at Old Woolhampton Lock and then at Kintbury. Many of the locks were difficult with a lot of water churning about. We were surprised to find Beckie and Buddy at one swing bridge that we were waiting at while it was being repaired. We eventually moored at Crofton Pumping station having shared many locks with some lovely people. We were pleased to see some very contented pigs in a nearby field in a 'house' made from bales of straw with a roof.</p>

<p>Robin joined us, as it was the Easter weekend, at Honey Street and we met the Bradshaws who happened to be at Devizes where Julie also joined us. Robin and Julie helped us with the Caen Hill locks and Joe dropped by, once we had moored up, on his way home from Scotland and the Lake District. He did a bit of cruising with us the next day and then walked back to his van. We made it to Bradford on Avon - a lovely place. We stayed a few days and Tony did some rust treatment on the boat. We quickly journeyed to Bath where we awaited Mary's arrival.</p>

<p>We had a visit from Robyn 'Hackett', who lives in Bath and Rose joined us for a day as we cruised to Keynsham were Rose left us.</p>

<p>We had three lovely days in Bristol where we saw Cathy and Will and were moored outside the cafe where Cathy worked. Our first night in the harbour was fitfull as the wind and waves were dreadful. The waves crashed along the sides of the boat. Joe visited too.</p>

<p>When we left Bristol Cathy came with us for a couple of days and did most of the driving back to Bath in a day. Cathy spotted a turtle sunning itself on a log. We had to have lunch in shifts as there was nowhere to stop. The next day, in Bath, we did a bit sightseeing before she went home on the train.</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Dundas, Avoncliffe, Bradford on Avon, Hungerford, Newbury, Windsor, Kingston and Brentford.</p>

<p>We still had Mary on board. We spent a couple of days in Bath doing two guided tours and visited, Beechen Cliff and Alexandra Park where we had lovely views of the city.</p>

<p>We moved on, stopped near Dundas and walked to Monkton Coombe, where we had visited in our early days and saw the 'Wheelwright Arms' pub where we had stayed, and to the basin on the Somerset Coal Canal. The next day we had a very interesting trip to the Claverton Pumping Station.</p>

<p>We cruised to Bradford on Avon where Claire and Keith visited and took Tony home when they left.</p>

<p>Mary left us here to go home.</p>

<p>Once Tony had returned from home we carried on back along the Kennet and Avon Canal.</p>

<p>We shared the Caen Hill locks with a boat called 'Clarinnish' and shared many locks to Hungerford with a single handed boater called Andy who was moving a boat.</p>

<p>John and Viv visited us at our lovely moorings in Newbury.</p>

<p>Tony was able to buy engine cooling hose here so he replaced the hose that was too short and we haven't had to worry about the hose coming loose since then. We shared all the locks from Newbury to the River Thames with a lovely Dutch Barge style narrowboat called 'Sterrenstof' (Startdust) and we moored on the river at Sonning after a long day. We hadn't planned to go this far but the opportunity to share locks was too great.</p>

<p>We cruised the Thames to Brentford mooring at Henley where Chris and Sara visited, Marlow and Maidenhead where we had an unfortunate encounter with a large river cruiser which wanted to moor up where we were moored.</p>

<p>From there we travelled to Windsor which we explored along with Eton. Our upcoming transit on the tidal Thames was looming and there was uncertainty whether our online passage booking had been taken. We ended up moored at Kingston with a hastily revised plan to do the Thames early the next morning, when a lockkeeper would be in attendance or at least should have been. We feared that we might end up sat on the mud at Brentford but the keeper turned up in time and we moored up, very relieved, at Brentford. It was good to be in safety on the Grand Union Canal.</p>

<p>Because of our early start we had the whole day to visit Kew Gardens on foot.</p>

<p>The next day we took the Paddington Arm and after a long day moored in Alperton where John and Melissa visited us. They cruised with us to Paddington where we were lucky enough to find a mooring and surprised to find that we could stay there for seven nights, so we did!</p>

<p>We did a lot of sight seeing including a remotely guided tour from Julia, which included the church of St Bartholemew the Great and Postman's Park.</p>

<p>We had a visit from Kirsty, her brother and her mum and Robin.</p>

<p>We watched the two bridges in Paddington basin being lifted, bought Groundling tickets from the Globe Theatre for The Merry Wives of Windsor and went to St Paul's cathedral for a service so we could get in for free!</p>

<p>It was the first time we had spent such a long time in London and we really enjoyed the freedom it gave us.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Paddington To: Leamington Spa (alight here for Newquay)</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: London Zoo, Limehouse, Copper Mill Lock, Harefield, Berkhamsted, Wendover Arm, Aylesbury, Linslade, Fenny Stratford, Milton Keynes, Cosgrove, Stoke Bruerne, Weedon, Braunston and Calcutt.</p>

<p>We left Paddington and cruised the Regents Canal past the zoo where we saw only some pigs' ears poking up. We shared most locks to the junction of the Hertford Union Canal with a boat called 'Incommunicado' and then with another boat to Limehouse where they had moorings. Limehouse moorings appeared full so we moved on and moored at Bow Locks. Here Craig passed by unrecognised in a train running on a bridge over the water. The next day we continued in a loop back to the Regents Canal along the Hertford Union canal passing a boat where a long running party was still active and meeting a helpful young man at Ford lock who had a near identical boat to ours which he is living on and moors in various places from where he can cycle to work..</p>

<p>We moored at Alperton and then Copper Mill Lock where Tony walked into Harefield. The next day at Stockers Lock there was some sort of religious chanting going on in a marquee in a park next to the canal. This turned out to be 'Prayer in The Park', the Eid Salah at Rickmansworth Aquadrome. We shared a couple of locks with a man growing hops on his boat which he used for homebrew. He explained that it was difficult getting them to grow horizontally. He was moving to safe moorings for his holiday in Cornwall.</p>

<p>The next day we met a couple who were off to a marina to sell their boat after two years and move to a bungalow in Norfolk. At lock 71 we came across a boat and butty. The butty was mostly bitumen! The occupants recommended the 'Rising Sun' pub at Berkhamsted known to locals as 'The Riser' which we later visited for good beer.</p>

<p>We needed to get to Leamington Spa where we planned to moor while we got a train to Cornwall to camp with friends. So, we made good progress to Cow Roast, sadly no roast cow, and we found time to do the Wendover Arm. From there we explored Tring and its amazing Natural History Museum, part of the London Natural History Museum, and spent a day walking along the rest of the canal which was being restored and was very interesting.<p>

<p>Then we had a couple of days in Aylesbury after struggling up some of its shallows. Then we moved to Linslade and missed the visitor moorings as we were hoping for something better. We had just about moored up when a man in the boat opposite asked if we would move up a little as we were disturbing his TV signal!</p>

<p>From there we passed through the lovely Soulbury Three Locks and moored at Fenny Stratford just after the shallow lock with a swing bridge over it. We walked into town but it was peculiar with a strange arrangement of shops.</p>

<p>Near Milton Keynes we stopped by a park at Newlands and walked to the Camphill Cafe, in a residential community for people with learning difficulties. We had a lovely vegan carbonara with salad and garlic bread and date scones.</p>

<p>We moored at Wolverton, explored the Secret Garden and visited the Biergarten MK where we found interesting craft beer and bought a bottle of gin to take to Cornwall and where we waited for Cathy to join us after being delayed on the train.</p>

<p>With Cathy on board we visited a nice pub, the 'Barley Mow' in Cosgrove, passed through Stoke Bruerne where we jump started another boat, did the Blissford Tunnel and had a lovely curry in the restaurant we had used in Weedon at the start of Liberty Belle's adventures last year.</p>

<p>Cathy left us and Norton and we made our way the next day to Braunston where we had the obligatory bangers and mash for lunch. Ther was just one more stop at Long Itchington before mooring at Leamington Spa for our train journey to Higher Moor for our camping holiday prepared for us by Rose and Julia.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Leamington Spa To: Walsden</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Birmingham, Fradley Junction, Lichfield, Rugeley, Great Haywood, Stone, Stoke on Trent, Newcastle under lyme, Congleton, Macclesfield, Bollington, Marple, Manchester and Littleborough</p>

<p>After nearly two weeks at Higher Moor we returned to Liberty Belle in Leamington Spa.</p>

<p>A couple of days later Garry and Helen followed us from Higher Moor and we had a lovely couple of days with them, firstly moored in the Saltisford Arm where we visited a nice pub 'Cape of Good Hope', had a barbeque and looked round Warwick and did the Hatton Flight of locks.</p>

<p>Tony went home from here for a few of days while Rachel explored around Hatton.</p>

<p>We wanted to get to Yorkshire fairly quickly fearing that the Yorkshire canals would close due to lack of water as happened last year.</p>

<p>So we followed the Grand Union to Birmingham and Salford Junction. On the way Tony damaged our chimney cover by being blown into a bridge that he was sheltering under and we met a group of lads menacingly playing Monopoly by the side of the canal. We then joined the Birmingham and Fazeley canal. At Fazeley Junction we turned onto the Coventry Canal and headed for Fradley Junction.</p>

<p>The Trent and Mersey Canal took us to Lichfied, which we liked and then to Rugeley where Aub had had his first fishing experience as a lad. Tony was stung by a bee at Great Haywood.</p>

<p>At Weston we tried to get help for an injured swan and visited a pub 'The Woolpack' where, by chance, we had cheap beer as it was a Tuesday!</p>

<p>While investigating the short locks in Yorkshire Tony rediscovered that we need a hand spike to operate some of the lock paddles and may buy a pick axe handle to make one from.</p>

<p>We liked the stretch of canal through Stone and Stoke on Trent. The old botttle kilns were lovely and we saw a skip full of reject pottery. We navigated the Harecastle tunnel and stopped for the night on the Macclesfield Canal. Tony did a bit of DIY while the rain fell and put an extra shelf in the cupboard under the TV to seperate the cables from the rest of the cupboard.</p>

<p>There were plenty of pretty bridges, some very close together on the Macclesfield Canal and we travelled through Congleton and Macclesfield stopping at Bollington which we really liked. We walked along the canal and up the hill to the White Nancy monument. The views over the town and countryside from here were stunning. Tony thought they were possibly the best non-mountain views he had ever seen. This stretch of canal was beautiful with canalside mills, stone bridges and views of the hills.</p>

<p>Tony walked a couple of miles to buy a pick axe handle to make a Calder and Hebble Handspike!</p>

<p>We did all the Marple locks and carried on to the Ashton-Under-Lyne junction. We were a little concerned at having to go through Manchester but it was much better than when we had done it on a hire boat. We couldn't even recognise the area where our boat had been boarded by youths because of the modern developments.</p>

<p>We had time to explore Manchester and particularly like the Industry and Science Museum with its working cotton mill machinery. But the canal was uninviting and had a serous problem with drug abuse.</p>

<p>We followed the Rochdale Canal and met the team making a BBC4 series 'Canal Boat Diaries' when we couldn't open one set of lock gates.</p>

<p>We carried on and eventually moored up at Littleborough. We had planned to stop earlier but had trouble finding a place to moor. We spent a few days there and were pleased to have visits from Garry and Helen. We did a few walks in the area, to Blackstone Edge reservoir, Geddings Dam and Todmorden. Tony modified the pick axe handle, using only a handsaw and Stanley knife, and produced what we hoped would pass the test as a Calder and Hebble Handspike.</p>

<p>As we left we passed Nick and Margaret on 'Theodora ' though we were too late recognising them to talk. We stopped at Walsden having seen a lovely stag on one of the hills.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Walsden To: Barnoldswick</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge, Elland, Brighouse, Wakefield, Castleford, Leeds, Saltaire, Bingley locks, Silsden, Skipton and Gargrave.</p>

<p>We left Walsden and made our way to Todmorden where we tried a second method of sinking the boat, fortunartely aborted by Rachel. We did need a calming beer afterwards!</p>

<p>We then headed for Hebden Bridge but stopped short at Stubbing Wharf just outside the pub. We wanted to check that moorings were available in town but ended up staying where we were for some days as all the 14 day moorings were full. Hebden Bridge was lovely. While there we had visits from Garry and Helen and had a lovely walk to Lumb Hole Waterfall, Gibson Mill and Heptonstall where we visited Sylvia Plath's grave. The next day Garry took us to the 'Blue Pig' beer festival which was lovely - a pub run by voluteers with limited opening hours. A fire in an old mill at Mytholmroyd prevented us moving on so we stayed several days at Stubbing Wharf.</p>

<p>Monica and Neil came to stay and we did the deepest lock at Tuel Lane and then moored in Sowerby Basin. We spent a day in Halifax where we saw all the sights - the Minster, the Piece Hall, the Victoria Hall and the Council Chambers and finally Dean Clough Mill. We both loved Halifax and our evening in Sowerby Bridge was nicely finished with a curry and a massive table naan, something we hadn't seen before.</p>

<p>After a stop at Salterhebble  we tackled the short locks on the Calder and Hebble canal with some trepidation. Having four of us to keep a look out for danger we quickly 'mastered' the whole process. We moored up in Elland Basin and walked up to Garry and Helen's where we had a lovely meal, walked up to Garry's smallholding to see his hens and new chicks, and then went to the pub! A lovely evening.</p>

<p>Neil and Monica left us and we had a few walks near Elland over the next days and then moved on to Brighouse where Anne and Mark came to see us.</p>

<p>We had some problems with high water levels but eventually made it through Ledgard Flood Lock and later the Wakefield Flood Lock. We explored all the sights of Wakefield and were pleasantly surprised as the town didn't look that special when Tony first walked in.</p>

<p>We made our way through the enormous locks on the Aire and Calder Navigation and found lovely moorings on a pontoon in Leeds Dock. We only had just over a day in Leeds but it was long enough to see what was there.</p>

<p>Almost exactly a year after the start of our adventures on Liberty Belle we had a visit from Cathy who joined us at the lovely Saltaire. Garry and Helen popped in on their way home from a weekend away. We then tackled the Bingley locks.</p>

<p>The next day we had problems finding a Sunday pub lunch but were not disappointed by a curry in a Skipton curry house in the evening. We loved Skipton and found the best pork pies there in an award winning pie shop called 'J. Stanforth' (The Celebrated Pork Pie Establishment). There was lots to see around Skipton. Cathy left us after we had spent a whole day looking round.</p>

<p>We did some walking and then moved on to Gargrave and finally to Barnoldswick (also kown as Barlick) where we visited the very interesting  Bancroft Mill and a lovely little micro pub 'The Barlick Tap Ale House' where we ate sausage rolls made by the owner's mum and sold for a donation to charity.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Barnoldswick To: Barbridge Junction</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Burnley, Blackburn, Chorley, Wigan, Liverpool, Worsley, Sale, the Anderton Boat Lift, Middlewich, Chester and Ellesmere Port.</p>

<p>Tony started replacing the rooftop TV aerial which had never worked. He had had a new one in store for a while. Before leaving Barnoldswick we walked up to find the old canal arm leading to the quarry.</p>

<p>We were now on a mission to reach Liverpool to collect Mary for a cruise to Chester. Tony managed to book a stay in Liverpool Docks.</p>

<p>We had been advised to go through Burnley early, before the yobs get out of bed. We saw no yobs but the Burnley Embankment, one of the six wonders of the canal network, was extremely shallow so progress was slow and we moored outside the Weavers' Triangle Visitor Centre. This visitor centre was interesting but they hadn't made full use of their exhibits. Burnley itself had little to offer.</p>

<p>The Leeds and Liverpool Canal through Blackburn was horrendous with shallow and weedy stretches which resulted in Liberty Belle damaging her propeller.</p>

<p>We stopped at Withnell Fold and had a look at the workers' cottages arranged round three sides of a square with some stocks at the open end. The cottages had two little doors in their yard wall which Rachel established were for emptying the privy bucket and the higher one to pass other 'goods' through.

<p>Our journey through Chorley and Wigan was better though the damaged propeller made the journey less restful with a juddering rudder. We didn't have the option of booking in to a boatyard for repairs as we had to get to Liverpool on time.
After Wigan locks we stopped at Crooke on what turned out to be a private mooring but they let us stay there.</p>

<p>We passed by the Lancaster Canal as we didn't have time to explore there but carried on with haste to Liverpool where we had a booking for a specific date. We stopped at Burscough and then Maghull as there was a suggestion that the canal onwards to Liverpool was unsafe. The next day we went through a swing bridge that was closed over the rush hours and carried on to Liverpool. The last few miles on the canal were slow due to the shallowness and the wind made it tricky.</p>

<p>We spent a few days in Liverpool, where we discovered a laundrette operated by a phone app and a lovely pub called the 'Lion Tavern' which had a beautiful ornate interior. We had a free electric hookup in the docks and Tony managed to buy an electric heater in a closing down sale so we had some comfort!</p>

<p>Once we had collected Mary we did a couple of sight seeing bus tours. We also did Tate Liverpool, the Metropolitan Cathedral and the lovely library and its reading room.</p>

<p>We retraced our path to Wigan which we visited this time and followed the Bridgewater Canal to Worsley, which was very interesting being the birthplace of the canal network, and the outskirts of Manchester. We passed through Sale which was a surprisingly nice modern town and visited the gardens of the National Trust property Dunham Massey Hall. Lymm was pretty but quite small so we didn't stay very long. We joined the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook and took a brief trip on the Anderton Boat Lift onto the River Weaver and back.</p>

<p>We continued through the more bleak lansdscape near Northwich to the prettier Middlewich. Here we went along the shortest of Britains canals, the Wardle Canal, only a few yards long bridging the gap to the Shropshire Union Canal (Middlewich Branch).</p>

<p>The Shropshire Union Canal then took us past Beeston Castle and into Chester. We had a nice few days sight seeing in Chester, most notably walking the Walls, and and then took Mary to Crewe on the train to see her off home. There we had our first delicious second beakfast involving Staffordshire oat cakes!</p>

<p>After Mary had gone we had a quick trip to Ellesmere Port, where we visited the very interesting and well presented Ellesmere Port Waterways museum, and back to Chester and then started our return along the Shropshire Union with a plan to visit the Lllangollen Canal. We made it almost back to Barbridge Junction.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Barbridge Junction To: Birmingham </p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Hurleston Junction, Whitchurch, Ellesmere, Chirk, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, Llangollen, the Montgomery Canal, Nantwich, Market Drayton, Tyrley locks, Norbury Junction, Gnosall Heath, Wheaton Aston, Brewood, Autherley Junction, Wolverhampton and Dudley.</p>

<p>We set off through the the top lock at Hurleston. Canal and River Trust people were helping boats through as the lock is narrow and the walls have shifted making passage difficult.  We bought jam and a book in a the second hand 'bookshop' at the bottom of the Grindley Brook locks. There was assistance through the staircase and we then stopped for water. We moored up just after the arm to Whitchurch.</p>

<p>The next day we moored in the arm to Ellesmere and had a walk looking at the sculptures. We had done this trip on a hire boat shortly before we bought our boat so did not hang about. The next day we stayed overnight at the mooring at the end of Chirk Tunnel and then moved off to Lllangollen where we encountered a load of dogs in the canal and a man trying to retrieve them. We had a free electric hook up here so we had the luxury of an electric heater and almost instant cups of tea from the kettle!</p>

<p>We had been  a little concerned that the canal might be too shallow for us as the draught of Liberty Belle was listed as greater than that recommended for this part of the canal. But all went well and when we measured our draught using the boat hook it seems that it wasn't as big as we thought.</p>

<p>While there we did some walks. We walked up to Castell Dinas Bran on the nearby hill. The views were great and there was more castle left than we expected. We walked all the way back to the Pontcysyllte aqueduct. While we were sheltering from the rain there, an elderly man came through the bridge on a day boat and smashed into the canal wall, put it in reverse without checking and almost bashed a boat. He then repeated the crash forwards into the swing bridge near the visitor centre! On our way back we had a lovely roast lamb dinner in the 'Sun Inn' in Trevor.</p>

<p>We did some planning for our return to Leamington Spa, to work out when we would be able to go home, and to our winter location around Milton Keynes.</p>

<p>After a few days we headed back from Llangollen, stopping this time to do the short Prees Branch and the longer, more rural, Mongomery Canal for which we had had to book our passage as they only allow six boats through each day.</p>

<p>The Mongomery Canal was uninteresting. It was narrow as they are restoring it as a 'wild' canal and it was hedge lined so there were no good views even though there were nice hills in the background.  We stopped for our lunch at Queens Head and then set off again through the three locks. As we got near Maesbury the canal became shallow and we decided to turn at the winding hole near bridge 78. This was a mistake! This was a bit too narrow and shallow but after some engine revving from the back and then taking the bargepole to the front while Rachel did the revving we managed to get round and moored up.</p>

<p>We the walked up to the navigation limit beyond bridge 81. Maesbury Marsh had some nice buildings and this was the nicest part of the canal.<p>

<p>We again made good progress back along the Llangollen canal and went through the first three locks at Hurleston unassisted but had two lockkeepers monitoring our passage through the fourth narrow one. We then cruised on and moored just before Nantwich Aqueduct. Liberty Belle was now in her home ground!

<p>Nantwich was lovely but the following day we moved on through Audlem, where Rachel discovered home made cakes for sale at the side of the canal and where we walked back for nice beer and a lovely meal at the 'Shroppie Fly' pub.  Next came the Adderley locks and on to Market Drayton with its confusing mooring signs. Here we discovered the amazing 'Red Lion' pub with Joules' Brewery. We also managed to find time to service the boat! The following day we discovered that our inverter had stopped working and were worried that we had done something to it while carrying out the service.</p>

<p>We passed through Tyrley locks, Norbury Junction and Gnosall Heath to Wheaton Aston where we had a short delay due to a lock closure. Once it re-opened we quickly did the three miles to Brewood and moored up. We walked into town, quite a pretty place with lots of old buildings alongside new housing. The church of Saint Mary the Virgin and Saint Chad was lovely, very broad arches inside, with lovely wooden ceilings. We then moved on to Brewood and Autherley Junction ready for the long flight of 21 locks to Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>The long flight went well and we spent the night moored outside the lovely Black Country Museum and the next day headed into the city. We enjoyed the industrial canals very much and were both excited about returning to Birmingham. Underneath the M5 motorway there was scaffolding everywhere. The engine house at Smethwick was lovely. We stopped for a while in the first lock at Smethwick so we could look at Telford's Aqueduct. It was sad to see the little lockkeeper's hut burnt out by vandals.

<p>We moored in a 14 day spot in Cambrian Wharf in central Birmingham which Rachel had discovered.<p>

<p>Here Tony contacted the manufacturer of our inverter who are located in Dulwich. They say that we will have to send it back to them so Tony decided to take it home with us where we will have a better chance of making a secure package of it.</p>

<p>We met up with Julia, did some sight seeing and got a lift home from Robin who happened to be passing somewhere nearby. At home we spent some time doing some jobs. Tony made a table extension and some windlass storage for the boat.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Birmingham To: Hawkesbury Junction</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: The Birmingham Canal Network (BCN), Fazeley Junction, Atherstone and Nuneaton.</p>

<p>We had a lot of things to bring to the boat, including windlass storage that Tony had made while at home, and a hire car was a reasonably cheap option.</p>

<p>We took the opportunity to take our broken inverter back to the manufacturer at Droitwich on the way. Tony then had to take the hire car back to Eastleigh. The man phoned the next day to say that the inverter was ready and that it was just a broken switch. When Tony got back to Birmingham he travelled on the train to collect it and he didn't charge me!</p>

<p>While in Birmingham we explored the Jewellry Quarter and the Botantic Gardens. The Christmas Market opened while we were there. We needed to get the boat booked in to replace the propeller which we damaged back in September. Tony managed to book her in for the start of December in Brinklow.</p>

<p>We decided to change our plans and to spend the intervening time exploring the Birmingham Canal Navigations. (BCN) These turned out to be mostly uninteresting and frequently shallow so it was not a particularly pleasant experience. It took a bit of planning to try to visit all the canals.</p>

<p>We started with the Port and Soho Loop. Then up the six locks to Titford but on approaching the winding hole we were grounded and decided to reverse all the way back to the lock using the engine and ropes to pull us along. We went up the Ryder's Green Locks to Walsall and explored the town and then moved on to Brownhills and Daw End where there was a lock closure which we already aware of.</p>

<p>We retraced our path and travelled to the end of the Angelsey Arm and back which was quite pretty. We turned at Pelsall Junction and did a bit of that arm, turning at the Old Brownhills Collier. We returned via Sneyd and Wednesbury, which looked nice but we didn't have time to stop. We went a little way up the Wednesbury Oak Loop but that was really shallow and we only planned to go to the winding hole as there was some doubt as to whether you could turn at the end.</p>

<p>We stopped again at the Black Country Museum and explored Dudley, had a day in the museum itself and went on a trip boat into the Dudley tunnels. We returned through Tipton and again went up the Ryder's Green Locks to allow us to join the Tame Valley Canal to travel to Salford Junction.</p>

<p>Overall the BCN network was not a pleasant experience. We had at least hoped for some interesting old industrial buildings but these were limited.</p>

<p>We headed for Fazeley Junction and joined the Coventry Canal which was very pretty and quite busy. We stopped for a late lunch at Polesworth and then walked into the village where we saw the old school, the gatehouse to the old abbey and a lovely vicarage which was the second replacement for the abbey buildings. We had a look round Atherstone and explored Nuneaton, which mainly had George Eliot connections, and ended up at Hawkesbury Junction on our way to the boat yard.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Hawkesbury Junction To: Marsworth</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Brinklow Boat Yard, Braunston, Weedon, Blissford Tunnel, Cosgrove, Fenny Stratford and Soulbury Locks.</p>

<p>We dropped off the boat at the boatyard and made our way home while it was being repaired and blacked which required some logistics. We travelled from the boatyard to Rugby by bus and then had a hire car to get home. Over a week later we returned to the repaired boat and made a plan to get the boat somewhere safe for Christmas. We made our way to Braunston, where we bought coal, and Weedon where we treated ourselves to a curry in the Indian restaurant there.</p>

<p>We went through Blissford Tunnel and moored at Cosgrove and made good progress to Fenny Stratford and through Soulbury Locks.</p>

<p>There were a couple of winter lock closures, one before Christmas and one after so we had to he careful that we were in the right place. The safest option would be to get as far as Berkhamstead but we decided to just go as far as Marsworth, near enough to walk to Tring station, and go home a bit earlier. We then had to be sure we would have time to get to Berkhamstead in early January.</p>

<p>When we travelled up this canal earlier in the year we had decided that this would be a good place to spend the winter and explore the towns nearby. But, because we spent time doing the BCN and getting the boat repaired this was not possible.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Marsworth To: Brentford</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Berkhamstead, Hemel Hempstead, Kings Langley, Watford and Cassiobury, Rickmansworth, Harefield, Uxbridge and the Slough Arm</p>

<p>After our rushing about before Christmas we were able to relax a bit when we returned to the boat after Christmas. We had to get to Berkhamstead because of the threatened closure but this was, in fact, delayed.</p>

<p>We were able to spend some time in Berkhamstead and did some walks and exploring including Berkhamstead Castle, the WWI training trenches which had been dug along Berkhamstead Common, the monument to the Earl of Bridgewater responsible for building the first canal at Wolseley where we visited when Mary was on board earlier in the year, Grim Ditch and Potten End.</p>

<p> We then moved on to Hemel Hempstead which we also explored and did some walking in the area. Tony put up some wire baskets that we had found in a charity shop to store our vegetables on the boat.</p>

<p>Joe needed to come up to work in London for a day so we needed to find somewhere for him to visit and be able to get a train into London. So, we moved on to Kings Langley where he came with his dog Carter and we looked after him while Joe was at work.<p>

<p>We then stopped at Cassiobury and spent time there exploring the local area and Watford. We moved on to Stockers Lock and visited Rickmansworth and Harefield. Here there was a cemetry for Australians who died in the Second World War. The hospital here had been set up to care for injured Australian servicemen.<p>

<p>We managed to do plenty of walks along this stretch.</p>

<p>We had decided to do the River Lee and the River Stort before heading to the Basingstoke Canal for the end of March when it reopens after the winter.</p>

<p>Joe wanted to come up for a week and work from the boat or in London at the beginning of February and both Joe and Kirsty wanted to join us for Half Term week either in London or on the River Lee.</p>

<p>So we started to make a plan. We didn't want to get to Paddington too early so decided to go to Brentford as there are good facilities there and railway stations.</p>

<p>In passing we did the Slough arm which was more pleasant than we expected though we avoided the really shallow end of the canal.</p>

<p>While in Brentford we again visited Kew Gardens and saw parts we had not seen before.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Brentford To: Hertford</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: Greenford, London Paddington and the River Lee</p>

<p>After a few days in Brentford, Joe joined us. We stayed in Brenford for a while and then made our way to Greenford where Joe eventually left us</p>

<p>We rode out Storm Ciara in Greenford and then moved on to Paddington where we had trouble accessing our booked moorings.</p>

<p>We spent a few days exploring London from our moorings in Paddington until Joe and Kirsty came. After a couple more days there we set off towards the River Lee. Joe worked on the boat most days and we made our way to Hertford via Hackney Marshes, Waltham Abbey and Broxbourne. The top end of the River Lee was lovely.</p>

<p>We spent several days at Hertford and then headed home on the train and stayed for over a week. While there Tony did his VHF radio course ready for our plan to go through central London on the Thames.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Hertford To: Lower Sunbury</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: the River Lee, the River Stort to Bishops Stortford, the Olympic Park, Limehouse Basin and Central London</p>

<p>We spent a little longer in Hertford and, after servicing the boat headed back down the River Lee stopping at Ware for a few days where we managed a few walks.</p>

<p>Our next stop was the junction of the River Lee and the River Stort. While there Cathy phoned to see if she could come to stay for a while and we decided it was best if she planned to meet us at Bishops Stortford knowing that if we didn't make it there on time there were other railway stations on the way.</p>

<p>Before starting the River Stort, we retraced our steps to buy diesel and coal as we were running too low and with a guest on board we wanted it to be cosy.</p>

<p>On our way to Bishops Stortford we stopped at Roydon Mill and Sawbridgeworth.</p>

<p>By the time Cathy joined us were seeing the first signs of panic buying in the supermarkets beause of the Coronavirus panademic which was starting. Very soon we were being advised to stay indoors.</p>

<p> On our way back down the river we stopped near Sawbridgeworth and at Harlow where we had our last trip to a coffee shop before the lock down.</p>

<p>Because Cathy was on board we hatched a plan to do the Thames through London on the following Sunday. The weather forcast looked good apart from the winds which were actually stronger than predicted on the few days before. We stopped at Broxbourne and Alfie's lock before making our way to Limehouse via the Olympic Park.</p>

<p>Our trip through London was fairly quite and took about 5 hours from Limehouse to Kingston. The next day Cathy left us and we were forced to move on the following day as we had run out of water.</p>

<p>We were hoping to move slowly enough to get to the Basingstoke Canal when it was due to open at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony checked  up on the River Wey and Basingstoke canal. The Wey is only open to Guildford and the Basingstoke Canal is still closed until at least the end of the month. So we have decided to travel to Oxford as a convenient place to moor should we need to go home due to the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>We set off went through the lock at Hampton where the facilties were but as we were heading for Sunbury Lock another boater shouted out to us that Sunbury Lock was closed due to a sunken boat and we should moor up in the channel towards the weir where we would not be moved on.</p>

<p>Once we had moored, Tony checked for closures on the River Thames. This had been on Tony's list of things to do for at least a week and he had not learnt his lesson from last year! The water is a bit high on many parts of the Thames and there are several locks closed until the end of the month. It looked like the sunken boat wasn't going to be moved any time soon!</p>

<p>Soon after mooring at Sunbury we were being advised to limit our movement to essential trips only. We are expecting to be here many weeks.</p>

<p>We have lovely safe moorings with good views out the windows but opportunities for walking are limited. We are on the wrong side of the river so it is a half hour walk along dull roads to the towpath from where we can walk in either direction. Alternatively we can walk along the road to Hampton Court.<p>

<p>We have access to a small local supermarket and a larger Tesco about 40 minutes away. Fortunately we have enough diesel and gas for the time being and we can travel back a couple of miles and turn at the other side of the lock when we need water or toilet emptying.</p>

<p>We discovered a few walks to do including</p>

<ul>

<li>Sunbury Park, a reasonable sized park adjacent to our mooring, containing an ornamental walled garden which, sadly, is closed due to the lock down. It also contains a Ha-Ha and a couple of Cedar of Lebanon trees which suggest that a grand house used to be here though there are no information boards to tell more.</li>

<li>Sunbury Lock a short distance across the water from where we are moored but we have to walk for about 40 minutes on the road to cross Walton Bridge and join the towpath on the other side. Here we were able to see the buoy marking the sunken boat.</li>

<li>Thames Lock on the River Wey. Again we have to walk to Walton Bridge and join the towpath on the other side.</li>

<li>A long circular walk to Walton Bridge and back along the towpath to Molesey Lock via Sunbury Lock. From there, across the bridge to the entrance of Hampton Court Palace and back along the road or through the edge of Bushy Park. Near Hampton Court are some lovely old stables, the Royal Mews, built in the 1500s.</li>

</ul>

<p class="itinery">From: Lower Sunbury To: Lower Sunbury</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: the facilities at Molesey Lock</p>

<p>Our travelling was limited to four trips back to Molesey Lock to empty the toilet and collect water.
The first two visits we went through the lock to turn the boat round. It is about three miles to the lock and our first trip took about 5 hours mainly because we let another boat use the tap before us.</p>

<p>The second trip was quicker as we discovered another tap this side of the lock which flowed much better. We did the whole thing in three and a half hours.</p>

<p>Tony then discovered a tap in Sunbury Park across the road and used this to top up our water tank regularly. This meant that instead of having to make a journey because we needed water we could delay this trip until we needed to empty the toilet. This reduced our travelling from roughly once a week to about every fortnight. On our third  trip the flow of water in the river had reduced considerably and as no other boats were around Tony decided to risk reverse back beyond the weir and turn without having to go through the lock. He was forced to turn closer to the weir than planned as it pulled the boat's rear end across a bit. We made it safely and the whole trip took us less than two and a half hours.</p>

<p>For our fourth trip the water flow had reduced even more but the turn near the weir was still a bit tricky.</p>

<p>We decided to make use of our lock down to do some jobs on the boat. This included</p>

<ul>

<li>Varnishing the taffrail.</li>

<li>Dealing with the rust around the diesel filling point.</li>

<li>Fixing the leak around the  water filling point. Some water had been making its way into the storage area beneath the bow for several months. On investigation Tony discovered that three of the four bolts securing the brass inlet had sheared off and the whole thing had lifted leaving a gap where the water could come in.</li>

<li>Painting the hatch which had become very tired looking. The new paint is much more yellow than the weathered cream paint but it still looks much better.</li>

<li>Paint over the rust patches on the side of the boat next to the path.</li>

<li>Paint the T-bar on the bow and the dollies at the stern where the ropes are secured when mooring and paint the hinges on the gas locker. These are now a lovely bright red instead of a tired, rusty and faded pink.</li>

<li>Start putting dim LEDs into the side of the light fittings to make it easier to find and turn them on in the dark.</li>

<li>Paint the decorative red stripe on the side of the boat.</li>

<p>Tony washed down the red stripe on the boat's paintwork, let it dry and then put masking tape round. He had to cut 32 curved pieces but this worked OK. The trickier bit was putting on the long straight bits of tape as it involved a lot of body contortion while lying on a very spiky, uncomfortable, concrete path edge! It took all morning to get to the point of painting it but it worked well and looks lovely.</p>

<li>Sand down and varnish round the inside of the window frames.</li>

<li>Sand down and oil the very sad looking barge pole and boat hook.</li>

</ul>

<p>On returning from our last trip to collect water we turned the boat round ready to tackle the rust on the other side of the boat. This meant that the rudder was facing upstream and moved around in the flow causing dinosaur-like noises. Tony secured the tiller using ropes the next day so as to not have his sleep disturbed!</p>

<p>We managed to get a gas cylinder delivered to the boat and think our diesel should last us until they let us move on.</p>

<p>A friendly woman brought us a print out from the Environment Agency explaining why the sunken boat in the cut above the lock had not been moved. Apparently the boat had  broken its mooring lines and drifted from Walton until it got caught on the weir. The owner had been rescued and the boat secured to the weir. The Environment Agency is not responsible for rescuing  boats in distress and has limited resources to do so. The owner shoud have arranged recovery but apparently did not. Eventually the boat became unsafe so the Environment Agency attempted to move it out of danger and at this point it sank.</p>

<p>One day Tony discovered some free Wi-Fi probably at the yacht club opposite so we have been using it when it works well enough.</p>

<p>Rachel's cousin Karen and her husband Jon came to visit us, keeping their Social Distance.</p>

<p>We discovered some more walks to do including</p>

<ul>

<li>Thames Lock on the River Wey. We have to walk for about 40 minutes on the road to cross Walton Bridge and join the towpath on the other side.</li>

<li>Shepperton Lock on the River Thames, mostly along roads but the roads around Old Shepperton are quite pretty.</li>

<li>Bushy Park, in the opposite direction, again along the roads but pasing the lovely 'Temple to Shakespeare' erected, in 1756, by the actor David Garrick who lived in a large house overlooking it.</li>

<li>A different, and more pleasant route along The Avenue to Tesco and M&S.</li>

<li>A pleasant walk running East-West beyond Sunbury Park with a lovely selection of trees.</li>

</ul>

<p class="itinery">From: Lower Sunbury To: Hampton Court Palace</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: the facilities at Sunbury Lock and Molesey Lock</p>

<p>We were still in Lockdown at Sunbury. Tony kept topping up the water tank each day from the tap in the park to avoid having to travel back to Molesey Lock so often. We also realised that we could empty the toilet by Sunbury Lock which is only a couple of hundred yards away.</p>

<p>We spent very nearly nine weeks at Sunbury. The days merge together with nothing distictive happening. We share a single banana each day on our breakfast muesli and seem to buy bananas every time we go to the supermarket. Our lives are ebbing away, one banana at a time!</p>

<p>On a phone conversation, John mentioned that he had a craving for fish and chips. This was contagious and within days we too developed a fish and chips obsession. We discovered that the local Fish and Chip shop called 'Red Herring' was due to reopen in a week or so. Unfortunately when Tony went to investigate on the day it was due to open there was a notice in the window saying that the fryer was not working and they were waiting on a part.</p>

<p>This month's jobs on the boat included</p>

<ul>

<li>Painting the red stripe on other side of the boat.</li>

<li>Two 'new' gang planks. Tony had discovered two lengths of heavy plank joined together and apparently discarded from a house renovation. Being slightly concerned that it wasn't actually discarded he made his way there at the crack of dawn, dismantled the two planks and carried them to the boat. A bit of cleaning, sanding and waxing made them look more legitimate.</li>

<li>Painting the roof. Karen and Jon taking delivery of two seperate orders of paint meant that Tony could put a couple of coats of fresh cream paint on the roof. He did this in two halves, building some protection using the barge pole lashed to the solar panels and some tarpaulins help down by plastic bottles full of water. A soon as the tarpaulins were erected the wind came up so they had to be lashed down a bit better. When it came to painting the second half the wind was too great to use the tarpaulins so we just kept our fingers crossed that not too much debris and bird pooh would fall from the sky.</li>

<li>Starting to prepare the stern deck for painting.</li>

</ul>

<p>We discovered some more walks to do including</p>

<ul>

<li>A walk to Chertsey beyond Shepperton. This part of the River Thames is particulaly lovely.</li>

<li>The walk to Thames Lock on the River Wey but extended to skirt round Desborough Island. This is the part of the Thames we see from Shepperton village when we walk to Shepperton Lock.</li>

</ul>

<p>With the slight easing of lock down restrictions, it was lovely to be told by a passer by that the Sunbury Park Walled Garden had been re-opened. We had several visits for a look round and a sit down. The garden is lovely - formal beds with roses and a parterre, but with some more natural plantings.</p>

<p>During our stay at Sunbury we had been watching a very aggressive male swan seeing off the other birds. Tony had witnessed what he thought was the attack and killing of another swan, but after several minutes the other swan moved, pushed itself out of the mud using its head and headed off skulkily. The 'killer' swan's nest was nearby and we eventually saw seven eggs in the nest. One morning we saw three cygnets but the next day they were gone - just one egg left and a tiny corpse in the nest. We suspect the father!</p>

<p>We became aware that we might be allowed to move on 1st June and fancied spending some time outside Hampton Court Palace for a change of scene. Usually you have to pay to stay here so the temptation was too great. Once the roof was painted we set off and moored just outside the palace.</p>

<p>We still have the problem of the sunken boat near Sunbury Lock and we walked up there to witness the dive team surveying the wreck. They need to do more work before they can lift it so we still don't know when we will be allowed to move.</p>

<p>We now have walks without having to walk along the road. We have easy access to Home Park with its Long Water and we can walk to Kingston upon Thames through the park or along the river.  Bushy Park is also nearby. Both have herds of deer, both Red Deer and Fallow Deer.</p>

<p>To finish the month we had a short trip to collect water from Molesey Lock and a day visit from Robin.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Hampton Court Palace To: Thrupp</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: the River Wey to Guildford, the River Thames to Lechlade and Oxford</p>

<p>While stuck at Hampton Court, Tony was able to paint Liberty Belle's stern deck and put some non-slip tape on our new gangplanks.</p>

<p>We heard about plans to raise the sunken boat at Sunbury so walked up to watch the whole procedure which was quite interesting.</p>

<p>A man came to tell us that mooring fees were to be re-introduced but we were determined to get Fish and Chips at Sunbury when the shop opened. So we had a trip back to Kingston-on-Thames for a couple of nights where we could easily do some shopping.</p>

<p>Once we had had our long-awaited Fish and Chips (and mushy peas) at Sunbury we felt free to move off. We tackled the River Wey which was beautiful. At Cartbridge we had our first pint of Real Ale since the pub in Sawbridgeworth on the River Stort which we had visited with Cathy before the lockdown and it was delicious.</p>

<p>We had another pint, with a takeaway meal, when Joe and Kirsty visited.</p>

<p>We could only go as far as Guildford because there had been a breach just beyond Millfield Lock. While at Guildford, which we both liked, Carol visited for the day. We walked the last bit of the 'navigable' River Wey to Godalming and met up with Robin.</p>

<p>We eventually accepted that we would not be allowed on the Basingstoke Canal, as they had done no risk assessment to allow them to open up, so we came back to the River Thames after a week on the Wey.</p>

<p>We made good progress on the Thames with long days. There was nothing to see if we stopped and we had been to most of the towns and villages on our way down last year. We decided to stay at Henley for a couple of nights to rest. We stopped at Wallingford which we had not had time to see before.</p>

<p>After a night in Oxford we moved on to the stretch of the Thames to Lechlade which we had not been on before. The river was very pretty but there was not much to see on the way. In Lechlade we were terrorised by cows who wanted to eat our mooring ropes and lick our paintwork.</p>

<p>We planned to go home in a hire car from Oxford or Banbury. Rachel was unable to book a hairdresser appointment for when we go home so took the plunge and after an emergency purchase of hair clippers allowed Tony to cut her hair very short - a No. 6 all over! We came quickly back to Oxford with revised plans for Robin to drive us home, saving us some money on a hire car. Most of the moorings in Oxford were only for two days. What had been 14 day moorings last year were now only for two days!  The rarer seven day moorings were not particularly good so we carried on to Thrupp where we got the last of the seven day spots right next to the lift bridge and, slightly worryingly, overfilled our mooring space by a couple of yards. The next day we were driven home in Robin's car full of lots of stuff.</p>

<p>We had a week at home doing jobs. I was hoping to get my willow whips planted out in the garden to make a living gazebo.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: Thrupp To: The River Great Ouse and River Wissey</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: The River Nene and the Middle Levels</p>

<p>Robin drove us back to the boat and stayed on board for a few days. We travelled from Thrupp to Banbury. Robin caught a few crayfish over a number of days and left us at Banbury after a FIsh and Chips lunch to catch the bus back to Thrupp.</p>

<p>We had to wait in Banbury for a visit from Ben to service our fire extinguishers so we managed to do the Banbury Fringe Walk again. We moved the boat up from the station into town where Tony serviced the engine.  There was a lot of work going on to refurbish the water front area. There were cranes and noisey pumps and they erected protective scaffolding around our boat. When Ben arrived he realised that he needed to replace rather than service the fire extingishers so we arranged to meet again in Northampton.</p>

<p>We managed to have a meal in the lovely 'Folly' at Napton but only in the garden where they could provide the necessary level of social distancing. It was lovely to have beer and a meal.</p>

<p>Our plans for the rest of the year had included doing the rivers and the Middle Levels in East Anglia followed by the Witham Navigation and finally up to Yorkshire to do the remaining parts of the network there including Sheffield and York. We realised that this would have been difficult even if we hadn't lost three months to the Covid virus lockdown. Originally our modified plan included some of Yorkshire but eventually we abandoned the Yorkshire plans altogether and formulated a new plan to just do East Anglia and the Ashby Canal and then get Mary on the boat when we go back to Birmingham. From there we would do the River Severn down to Gloucester and maybe the Sharpness Canal before returning along the River Avon to Stratford on Avon.</p>

<p>We would keep Liberty Belle for another year and complete the North East area in a more relaxed fashion and perhaps do some longer distance walking from the boat.</p>

<p>We headed off to Gayton Junction, stopping for Barunston Bangers from the butcher. We had to wait for the Canal and River Trust to refill the locks to Northampton because one pound had been emptied.</p>

<p>We had our fire extinguishers replaced in Northampton and then moved onto the River Nene. We were not sure whether we had the required key and windlass for the next part of the journey but thought we would be able to purchase anything necessary on the way.</p>

<p>We loved the River Nene. There were good views unlike on the upper Thames and the water was deep and clear. We had joined 'The Friends of the River Nene' which allowed us to use their lovely moorings. People we talked to suggested that the river was even more lovely further up but we liked all of it. Stopping at villages was difficut as moorings were scarce and of limited size but we did manage to visit Great Doddington and Woodford and stopped at Fotheringhay for a couple of nights allowing us to do a walk.</p>

<p>Most of the locks were electrically operated guillotine locks but some had to be wound by hand using a large stainless steel wheel.</p>

<p>Peterborough gave us the chance to do a bit of shopping as Tony needed new walking shoes and we met up with Mary's friend Carol and her husband Dave. We also visited the cathedral but this was spoilt a little by the constricting face masks we had the wear. </p>

<p>We the set off and passed thrugh Stanground Lock onto the Middle Levels in quite strong wind. We had to buy an extra windlass and key to access the a locks and facilities. It was quite a dull landscape but worth seeing. We stopped at Whittlesey and March. Our new windlass was needed only at two locks. We had a strange encounter at Marmont Priory Lock which we had booked as they like to manage the water levels. When we got there it became clear that booking wasn't necessary unless you wanted assistance at the lock. A couple of hire boats just went straight through, with our assistance as they hadn't a clue what to do. We stopped at lovely moorings at Outwell and walked up for chips which had been recommended by the Marmont Priory lock-keeper.</p>

<p>The following day we had an appointment to go through Salter's Lode and Denver Locks via the tidal river in the afternoon. That went well and we travelled up the Great Ouse Relief Channel to Downham Market via the slowest filling lock we have ever encountered. The lock came as a surprise as we had no guide book or proper map. The following day we tackled the first of the tributaries feeding the Great Ouse, the River Wissey to Stoke Ferry and back almost the whole length of the river to moorings provided by 'The Great Ouse Boating Association' (GOBA) that we had joined online.</p>

<p class="itinery">From: The River Wissey To: Braunston</p>

<p class="itinery">Via: The River Great Ouse and its tributaries, Cambridge, Bedford and back via the Middle Levels and River Nene.</p>

<p>We left the River Wissey and travelled quickly along the broad River Great Ouse passing a sheep, which had somehow come to be in the water, attended by a couple of rowers. We made it onto the River Little Ouse which we thought much prettier than the Wissey. We passed through the RSPB reserve at Lakenheath where we saw Avocets and noted a good place to moor on our way back.</p>

<p>Near the end of the river at Brandon we encountered a lock which was too short for us so we had to reverse out and take a walk into Brandon town. Brandon was an important area of flint mines and produced gunflint. Rabbits were also farmed here. When we headed back to our planned moorings at Lakenheath we discovered lots of boat there and had to moor up with both gang planks slipping around in the mud.</p>

<p>Back to the River Great Ouse and down the River Lark to its end at Judes Ferry where we moored outside the pub and spent the afternoon sitting in the garden drinking Greene King 'Yardbird' beer and having a baguette each.</p>

<p>On the following day just after we left we had our first sighting of a Kingfisher hovering while fishing. We were planning to meet up with friends in Cambridge later in the week so hoped we would be able to moor at Ely where we could delay our progress a little. We were lucky and moored outside the Maltings.</p>

<p>Ely was beautiful with lots of interesting old houses and a stunning cathedral which we visited masked up, which spoilt the experience a bit.</p>

<p>We then moved on and turned onto the River Cam. We had originally planned to go straight into Cambridge but had had a suggestion from people we had met on our journey that the 'Lodes' were navigable and we had the time.</p>

<p>We were glad we did. The lock down to the Lodes was fairly short, electrically operated and had an automatic reset to a certain state if you didn't pass through in a timely manner.</p>

<p>First we did Wicken Lode which passes through the beautiful Wicken Fen nature reserve. There were lots of people around and bird hides were visible. The Lode was very narrow and we had to pass an oncoming steam launch on our way back.</p>

<p>We went to the end of Burwell Lode but there was no mooring space so had to retrace our path and travel down the extremely narrow Reach Lode which at some points was completely covered in reeds which parted either side of us and rejoined as we receded. it was a relief to find the GOBA moorings at the end.</p>

<p>We walked into Reach and were pleasantly surprised. A lovely village split in two by a long rectangular green. This was the end of the Devil's Dyke, about 7.5 miles long and built in Roman times or before and its use is not entirely known. Maybe defensive when there were warring tribes, maybe partly a path across the marshes.</p>

<p>We then moved on to Cambridge where we met up with Dave and Fiona. Tony hadn't seen Dave, a friend from university, for about 30 years and had never met Fiona.</p>

<p>We liked Cambridge. It seems much more intimate than Oxford but the weather was too hot and sunny to fully appreciate the city.</p>

<p>When we left Cambridge we had a fleeting visit from Joe, Kirsty and Carter when they realised that they were nearby. Later that day we went through Hermitage Lock which we hadn't realised was manned and Rachel, having got off to operate the lock, had to clamber over the barrier and down the lock ladder to get back on! Once through we saw a common seal. We hadn't realised that we were on a tidal stretch so thought the seal must have come through a lock to get here. In this case it hadn't need to but their curiosity does sometimes lead to them swimming from the Wash, negotiating several locks and going quite far inland.</p>
 
<p>Over the next few days we visited the lovely St. Ives with its old cattle market, Huntingdon where Oliver Cromwell went to schoool and where there was an ancient castle and bridge and St. Neots where we spent the afternoon and evening sitting in the shade in Riverside Park.</p>

<p>The hot weather held out and we sat in the park by the river at Bedford. Bedford town had some interesting buildings, a stainless steel sculpture of two heads facing each other representing brick working, lace making and dialogue between people and another castle.</p>

<p>We hatched a plan to collect Mary when we got to Coventry so Tony hired a car with the aim of using it to collect a new radiator for the boat too. On our way back from Bedford we stopped for lunch at Great Barford lock where Tony managed to trip up as he stepped off the bow after tying up with less than a yard of stray rope and fell onto the concrete edge and grazed his knee!</p>

<p>On our way back we moored overnight again at St. Neots and Tony had a bad night's sleep after being woken in the early hours by some very drunk youths who he thought might end up in the river.</p>

<p>We had seen the lovely moorings at Hemingford Grey on our way up so stopped there on the way back and explored both Hemingford Grey and Hemingford Prior and had a drink and snacks in 'The Cock'.</p>

<p>We got the last mooring space in Ely which was conveniently close to the tap which we used the next moring before setting off the next day. We were booked to go through Denver Lock later in the day and arrived in plenty of time which meant that we had to hang about for the whole afternoon. I spent the afternoon planning how we could get our domestic batteries replaced as they were performing very poorly.</p>

<p>I prepared the boat in case of collision when entering the lock. There was already a boat waiting at the lock landing. They had been moored behind us earlier. As we were waiting, drifting near the landing the thunder started again. It had been threatening earlier in the afternoon. We eventually moved into the lock and the lightning started. We were both freed onto the tidal stretch and the heavens opened. We have never been out in such rain! The first boat struggled to get into the lock. It looked like he had grounded himself. We had trouble too, nearly hitting the fence marking the channel into the lock and eventually hitting the tyre encrusted wall head on, but not too badly. We managed to power the boat round and had to wait until the lock was opened. The nice lock keeper, Paul, said we could stay on the landing stage overnight if we wanted to which came as a relief.</p>

<p>We wanted to explore some more of the Middle Levels and set off the next day turning onto the Sixteen Foot Drain. This was weedier and a bit shallower at times. We had trouble getting under Bedlam Bridge and bent the solar panel brackets. Then Boot's Bridge on the same run was very close too. We turned onto the Forty Foot Drain and were trying to get to Ramsey.</p>
			
<p>Our plans were scuppered by the Puddock Road Bridge which we could not get under so we had to turn back and moored at some excellent steel moorings nearby. We had seen some water coming in over a small weir on our way and there was water swirling up near the bridge so it looks like water levels have been raised by the rain.</p>

<p>Tony had measured the water level and by the next day it had dropped a few inches but with more rain predicted we decided to abandon our plans to visit Ramsey and retrace our steps. We feared geting into Ramsey and then being unable to get back out again.</p>

<p>Tony finalised plans to get our batteries replaced when we pass through Braunston and formulated another plan to replace the boats radiators when we get to Peterborough. Two radiators were now leaking! The plan involved ordering some radiators for collection, hiring a car for a day and using it to collect the radiators and dispose of the old ones. We hoped to be able to moor close to a car park. Finding the correct tools to fit the radiators proved to be a bit of a palaver. If we couldn't get the corect tool we wouldn't be able to dispose of the old radiators and would have to store the new ones until we could. Local 'plumbers merchants' were unable to help but B&Q came up trumps and had the correct imperial sized key which we needed.</p>

<p>Replacing the radiators was not without problems and Tony had trouble trying to buy a replacement joint which was leaking. He replaced the radiators using the leaky joint but did not refill them hoping to find the correct part on our travels or collect some ordered online when we went home.</p>

<p>We travelled on from Peterborough to Fotheringhay in some problematic wind and, the next day on the second anniversary of our Liberty Belle adventure, we arrived at Wadenhoe after having to retrace our 'steps' to retrieve a frogotten windlass. Here we had a celebratory beer in the teeming rain and then explored the lovely village and dovecote, a tall round building made of stone with a small wooden door. Inside were the remains of the 650 nesting compartments made from lath and plaster and a pivotting vertical ladder to enable inspection of the nests. The village had lots of lovely stone houses, several thatched but clearly all originlly thatched. We walked through to the church too. The whole village was lovely with undulating fields with rare breed sheep. The pub landlord told us that the whole village was held in trust and was built by the owners of the big house.</p>

<p>Fearful that the forecast rain might bring the water level on the River Nene up we wanted to find safe moorings. So we made our way to the Environmant Agency moorings at Irthlingborough. This proved to be a wise move. The rain from Storm Frances started. There was a boat called 'Barney' moored nearby and Jim and Margaret came to talk. Jim suggested that we might want to travel together when we do move off. Thus began a partnership that lasted for a few days. While moored there Jim came to warn us that our bow rope was coming loose so we were able to tie up again and avoid being dragged round by the current. The water level was up by about a foot but had dropped a few inches by the next day so we moved off together, made our way to Wellingborough for a lunch stop and then to Hardwater Mill for the night. The next day we made it to Northampton. Being paired up made it much easier.</p>

<p>After a day moored up in Northampton due to a forecast of heavy rain, which didn't materialise, we joined the Northampton Arm of the canal and cruised all the way to Wedom Bec losing Jim and Margaret on the way. We celebarted our arrival with a curry at the 'Brinjol' restaurant which is becoming a tradition with us.</p>

<p>We were joined again by Jim and Margaret the following day after our visit to Weedon Armoury and we travelled all the way to Norton Junction with them. We said our goodbyes with a few pints in the 'New Inn'.</p>

<p>We finished the month by continuing to Braunston in good time to prepare for our battery replacement.</p>

<p>When Tony serviced the engiine in Braunston he discovered the part he needed for the central heating leak so decided to fill and test the new radiators. A quick test suggested that all was well.</p>

<p>Simon came to replace our batteries and I then tested the radiators properly. Unfortunately the radiatotrs only get warm at the bottom. Some research on the internet suggested that the antifreeze concentration was too strong and hadn't been mixed before filling the radiators.</p>

<p>We managed to get all the way to Coventry in two days stopping at Rugby for the first night. Tony drained the radiators one by one and refilled them with mixed and diluted antifreeze. They now work properly.</p>

<p>We drove home for the weekend and collected Mary. The Canal and River Trust were advising not to travel on the Ashby Canal due to low water but the problem was resolved just in time. So, the following day we set of and started down the Ashby Canal. It was very pretty but with limited mooring options.</p>

<p>Over the next few days we stopped at Stoke Golding where we looked at the church where observers viewed the Battle of Bosworth Field. Then on to Bosworth which Mary had visited before. We went to the end of the canal through Snarestone Tunnel and had a look round the village.</p>

<p>On our way back we stopped at Shackerstone which has a picturesque motte and bailey and is a lovely village.</p>

<p>We were surprised that there didn't seem to be much wildlife on the canal but Rachel did spot a Water Vole opposite the boat on our last morning there.</p>

<p>Back on the Coventry Canal we stopped at Hartshill for a walk and had a good look round Atherstone. The canal was surprisingly lovely from Polesworth onwards. The Coventry Canal is one of the busiest canals we have been on.</p>

<p>This time we had no problems getting round Fazeley Junction and made it all the way to the Star City moorings near Salford Junction. We did a new bit of canal, the Digbeth branch and visited Typhoo Basin where we all had a cup of tea. We made it into Birmigham in a couple of hours after that.</p>

<p>We had our second visit to the Black Country Museum, this time with Mary, and had fish and chips and a pint there. We left the next day and went through the Netherton Tunnel. We were surprised how lovely the canal was on the other side of the tunnel. We moored at Brierly Hill and had a look round but Mary didn't recognise any of it and the town itself was run down and with no useful shops. The next day we made it to Kinver and the following day to somewhere near Stourport.</p>

<p>The next morning we went on the River Severn and moored at the lovely Upton on Severn where Mary bought us some delicious fish and chips. We were surprised to encounter barges transporting aggregate. The difference between the level they float in the water when empty and when full is amazing.</p>

<p>We were a little worried by the tidal section of the Severn into Gloucester with lots of warnings in the guide, more warnings from a man moored with us at Upton and finally some warnings and a set of instructions on a sheet of paper passed down in a bucket from the lockkeeper just before the tidal section. Fortunately all was well and we made it into Gloucester Docks with only one tree trunk partially obstructing our path through the Partings.</p>

<p>We visited the cathedral with its amazing cloisters and did a self guided walk we had found on the internet which was very interesting. We liked Gloucester.</p>

<p>At first we couldn't see the appeal of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as it was just straight and wide but we soon saw its appeal. We stopped at Frampton on Severn and walked through the village beside its half mile long green. There was also a wharf previously owned by Cadbury.</p>

<p>The views across the river at Sharpness were lovely and the Ships Graveyard at Purton was very interesting. From there we made it to Gloucester in just one day and had a look round the Priory Llanthony Secunda which was a priory founded by residents of the original priory in Wales who were being persecuted.</p>

<p>The next day we made it to Tewkesbury on the River Avon and had a look round there and again the following morning when the abbey was open  but we were disappointed not to be able to see all the extra, what we assumed were, chapels around the main alter. All the locks were a bit awkward as we had to tie up front and back which meant Tony had to climb out of the lock. At Pershore Lock we forgot to close the ground paddles so had to apologise to the next boat as they passed our moorings. Also, the lock landings were sometimes awkward or too short. We like the way the moorings are marked by light blue posts and lots are flood safe too. There were plenty of moorings available</p>

<p>We had a look round Pershore and then cruised on to Evesham where we moored at the Town Moorings.</p>
